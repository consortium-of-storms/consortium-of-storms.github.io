                        <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p>You are a Cyclopean.  You were once human, but that was before a thing you came to know as the Star Engine plucked you from Earth.  Without warning, one day while you were alone (only for a few moments), it plucked you up and swept you through the Fold.  You found yourself deposited, alone, into its desolate and alien chambers.</p>
<p>Your abduction was beyond traumatic: it was beyond any nightmare ever dreamt, more grotesque than any horror movie filmed.  You were spat unceremoniously, clammy with fungal slime, into a biomechanical operating theater in the heart of the Star Engine.  And there you were robbed of your humanity, forever.</p>
<h2 id="the-engraving">The Engraving</h2>
<p>You were restrained with the fleshy embrace of cold, wet fungal lobes within the theater, and then you were constricted until you absolutely still.  You could feel the contours and textures of the living machine, and then shortly after you could feel its sharp devices press into your skin and begin to tear you apart.</p>
<p>Every last moment of this process is seared vividly into your memories, every second of your vivisection.  You remember the sensation of being hollowed out, every obscene organic sound.  You remember when the pulsating mass entered you again, filled you up, and begin to knit you back together.</p>
<p>You don&apos;t know why you didn&apos;t die.  Did you die?  Are you dead?  Maybe.</p>
<p>There came a point where the cradle you were in stilled for a second or two, and then it began to churn and swirl again.  You were swept up anew, flushed through some sort of channel, and eventually you were vomited out upon the floor of a large, dimly phosphorescent chamber.</p>
<p>Your discarded organs and an impossible amount of blood surrounded you, covering you like the rags which used to be your clothes.  You shook violently with the cold and the shock of the trauma and you stared.</p>
<p>And there, in that low luminescence, in that lonely new biomechanical cavity: that was when you first began to perceive the Unearthly Whispers.  You began to feel the new organs inside of you whirl and churn and <em>activate</em>.</p>
<p>It told you that you had survived the Engraving.  It welcomed you back, but from where you don&apos;t know.  It said that the time had come to once again face the Unknowable, the <em>things beyond the Fold of reality</em>.  It told you its name - it was unpronounceable, save for its honorific: &apos;of the Star Engines&apos;.  It was a Star Engine.</p>
<p>Whispers of a distant memory infected your mind.  Not your memories, but anothers&apos;.  Was it even your mind anymore?  What had you been infected with?  What had you become?</p>
<h2 id="the-return">The Return</h2>
<p>Now, months later, you have returned to Earth from the Star Engine&apos;s holding, but things aren&apos;t as they once were.  You aren&apos;t anything close to human anymore and madness tends to follow you wherever you go.  Your friends and family may have been the first, but they certainly won&apos;t be the last.</p>
<p>When you hear stories of alien abduction, your attention perks.  Usually the culprits of these stories are attention seekers, but sometimes <em>there&apos;s something to it</em>.  Something news of phenomena or curious happenstance are genuinely the touch of the extraterrestrial.  Sometimes it precipitates another who is like you - someone who has been Engraved.  A Cyclopean, one of the Infected.</p>
<p>You know that there are thousands more just like you, others who&apos;ve been put under an organic imperative to serve the Star Engines.  Like you they are disfigured: though most of you can pass for human fully clothed, you certainly couldn&apos;t pass careful scrutiny.</p>
<p>For one, your chest is a lattice of grotesque scars, implementing a curious geometry into your flesh.  It&apos;s like a fractal demonstration of a dozen autopsies, and it&apos;s only the first of the tangible indications of your post-humanity.  There is so much more evidence of what you are than your scars, though.</p>
<p>There are the Apparata.  They are biomechanical machinery, distant micro-relatives of the massive Star Engine you were born in.  Inside you they unceasingly work - they keep you alive, let you cross into the Fold without dying, and they sometimes <em>turn you inside out, Inverting you into a completely new being</em>.</p>
<p>There are the Unearthly Whispers.  This is the living voice of the fungal symbiote you&apos;ve been coupled with.  It is an actual living part of you now and it has a will which neighbors your own.  It speaks to you, it overlays the fabric of other realities on your vision, it warns you of danger and tells you secrets, and you&apos;re pretty sure that it <em>slowly drives the people around you mad</em>.</p>
<p>And there is the Lidless Eye.</p>
<h3 id="the-lidless-eye">The Lidless Eye</h3>
<p>It&apos;s the only thing which you and all of the other Infected share in common: a single palm-sized Lidless Eye.  It peers around of its own free will, a horrific veined, too-detailed orb which seems almost completely impervious to harm.  Its black pupil expands and contracts in maddening syncopation with any stimuli.</p>
<p>You can peer through it, and in uncovering it you amplify the strength of your Unearthly Whispers while at the same time you expose the nature of your posthumanity.  Maybe you&apos;re hesitant to, though - because <em>what else could be looking through it</em>?  It isn&apos;t always you that controls where it peers.</p>
<p>There are many locations where the Eye emerges, but there are five places which are the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>The forehead</li>
<li>The throat</li>
<li>The chest</li>
<li>The upper back</li>
<li>The abdomen</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, some have it upon their shoulders, some within their palms, and some have more than one.  But most of the Infected have a single eye, centrally aligned with the spinal column.</p>
<p>In all cases the Lidless Eye is obscene, hideous and alien: it is an unholy thing which lays bare the lie of reality for any who see it, and emits pure madness in concentrated, erratic waves.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-just-happened">What exactly just happened?</h2>
<p>You were wandering alone - either you took a walk through a park, a short cut through an alleyway, or you were alone by a lake - and you thought you heard a whisper.  You paused to confirm, and that moment of hesitation, the world around you swept up in sudden light and you were <em>suddenly somewhere else</em>.</p>
<p>You were inside the Operation Chamber of a Star Engine.</p>
<h2 id="the-star-engines">The Star Engines</h2>
<p>Each Star Engine was once vessel for one of the many Empires of the Unknowable.  The Empires were ancient intergalactic civilizations, which grew powerful and then eventually fell under the dominion of the Distant Host: colossal, organic, alien proto-Gods.</p>
<p>Once the Star Engines traversed the universe at the command of the Unknowable, but now that those ancient Empires are dead and decaying, the Engines call for help, trying to gradually reinvigorate their missing masters by rebuilding other species into their image.</p>
<p>The Star Engine spoke to you, as you were vivisected, in a series of echoing Whispers.  It told you all of this, and then told you that you were part of that Exquisite Design - you were to stand in the place of this Unknowable race, and become part of the fungal, dimensional machinery they&apos;ve left behind.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>You are one of the Engraved, a human repurposed by the indelicate unanesthetized surgery of a Star Engine&apos;s operating Chamber.  Whatever your previous life, you now serve the Star Engine and its fallen Unknowable Empire.  Sometimes even willingly, you wage continual galactic war against the grotesque horrors which that empire has left behind.</p>
