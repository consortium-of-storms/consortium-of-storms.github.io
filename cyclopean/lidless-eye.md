### The Lidless Eye

It is the only thing you and all of the other Infected have in common:  One single, massive, palm-sized Lidless Eye.  You can even see through it, and so can whatever now forever Whispers in your skull.  Where the Lidless Eye is varies, but in all cases it is hideous and alien: an unholy testament to your bygone humanity.
