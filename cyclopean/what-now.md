## What now?

You are one of the Engraved, a human repurposed by the indelicate unanesthetized surgery of a Star Engine's operating Chamber.  Whatever your previous life, you now serve the Star Engine and its fallen Unknowable Empire.  Sometimes even willingly, you wage continual galactic war against the grotesque horrors which that empire has left behind.
