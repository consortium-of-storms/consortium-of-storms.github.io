### Symbiosis and Evolution

Over this long stretch of time a symbiosis began to emerge between the Star Engines and the Distant Powers.  The Star Engines became a massive host and advisory system, guarding and furthering the Powers.  In exchange, the Powers would provide supplicants to the Star Engines: members of the empire which would willingly submit for Engraving, and become living portions of the Star Engine's complex internal systems.

Indeed, the Distant Powers had even begun to evolve over time so that supplication into the machinery of the Star Engines was something that their body and mind could handle painlessly.  To become a supplicant was a great honor and many strove for it, not in the least because the Engraving bestowed transcendent ability on any who partook.

Distinct purposes were assigned to each supplicant dependent on their ability, and according to their will.  These were the Exquisite Designs: singular purposes which resulted from a particular combination of Apparata.

Every design was specifically suited to integration into the Star Engine in a different way.  Entire colonies of a particular design would inhabit the Engine in regions bent to their particular purpose - defensive systems, navigation systems, and so on.  These colonies became the functional empowerment of their particular Star Engine, a synthesis between fungal biomachinery and living will.

Over time, each Star Engine began to breed its own phenotype of Apparata, as the colonies and their descendants evolved more and more in the internal ecosystem of their particular home Engine.  Cultures of colonies became diverse across the Engines but homogenous within each particular Star Engine; the Distant Powers progressed into many subspecies as they spread inexorably between galaxies and into the Fold.
