## As a Cyclopean, you will

* Cradle within your human husk a grotesque array of alien **Apparata**
* Perceive the fabric of **Unearthly Whispers** which overlay reality
* Assume your **Inversion**, a warped, monstrous alien self
* Serve and occupy the vast supersentient husks of primeval God-Machines, drifting hollow through the void of space
* Struggle against the approaching monstrous agents of the *Unknowable*
* Begin the process of fashioning the Earth anew, infecting it with the dread machinery of the Star Engines.
