## The Star Engines

The Star Engines are a powerful fleet of supersentient biomechanical planets.  Each one is vast even in our reality, but their form doesn't stop there: they expand in every direction and dimension, each one stretching deep within the reaches of the Fold.

The Star Engines were originally instrumented and grown by the Distant Powers, an unimaginably old alien empire.  Over hundreds of thousands of years they were deliberately evolved and augmented, until they had become the primary home and means of conquest for the empire.
