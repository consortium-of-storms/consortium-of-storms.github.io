## The Star Engines

Each Star Engine was once vessel for one of the many Empires of the Unknowable.  The Empires were ancient intergalactic civilizations, which grew powerful and then eventually fell under the dominion of the Distant Host: colossal, organic, alien proto-Gods.

Once the Star Engines traversed the universe at the command of the Unknowable, but now that those ancient Empires are dead and decaying, the Engines call for help, trying to gradually reinvigorate their missing masters by rebuilding other species into their image.

The Star Engine spoke to you, as you were vivisected, in a series of echoing Whispers.  It told you all of this, and then told you that you were part of that Exquisite Design - you were to stand in the place of this Unknowable race, and become part of the fungal, dimensional machinery they've left behind.
