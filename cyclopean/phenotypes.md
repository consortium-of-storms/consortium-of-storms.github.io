## Phenotypes

### How you were rebuilt

The old Empires of the Distant Powers had a rich technological history, but their machinery was quite different from our own.  The most important difference is that their engines were almost all fungal biomachinery.  Throughout the millennia that the Empires thrived, they cultivated a broad spectrum of production means which were either fungal itself, or spawn by some sort of fungus.

Today, these fungal agents are regularly bred and reused by the Star Engines in order to create Cyclopean Apparata.  A specific combination of originating Apparata creates a Cyclopean of a certain _Phenotype_, or in other words, a specific blend of Cyclopean features.

Each Phenotype is achieved through a combination of Apparata, but is ultimately a distinct semi-species within the Cyclopean hierarchy.  Phenotypes are most commonly distinguished by physical and psychological capabilities, but also they each have a governing Apparata synergy, which presents itself in a few beneficial and a few detrimental ways.

Within a certain Phenotype, Cyclopeans are still very distinct from one another - each Cyclopean has their own individual gradiation of progressions within their distinct Phenotype synergies.

Which is a fancy way of saying that, for example, while all of the Veya'raj have access to the Veya'rajian Hivemind, not all of them have developed it to the same extent, nor do they all suffer from the same distant qualities which overtake those who have.

In a pragmatic way, Phenotypes have formed subcultures within the Cyclopean superculture.  Although they aren't necessarily predisposed to liking one another, they absolutely have a lot in common with one another and this fosters a great deal of comfort.  It's traumatic to become a Cyclopean, to say the least, and finding others like yourself means a lot to a newly posthuman.
