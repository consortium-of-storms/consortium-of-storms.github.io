# Overview

You were taken from Earth by an alien machine, only to be sundered alive, and Operated upon.  Your organs were violently pulled from you and then you were _rebuilt_ with a series of Exquisite Apparata.  Now the Apparata are a part of you and fill you with Whispers and strange, incomprehensible memories.

They continually churn and operate inside of you.  You don't eat, sleep or breathe anymore.  You see new, strange, fabrics of reality lain over the familiar everywhere you turn.

Throughout, you did not pass out, did not die - your memories of the entire process are vivid.  It felt like an eternity of dehumanizing pain.  But all of those memories are _internal things_.

There are only two pieces of *external evidence* of your torture and reassembly:

There are the scars where you were pulled apart by the Star Engine - now that you've been drawn back together, those scars bulge with oily, fungal seams.

And there is the Lidless Eye.

### The Lidless Eye

It is the only thing you and all of the other Infected have in common:  One single, massive, palm-sized Lidless Eye.  You can even see through it, and so can whatever now forever Whispers in your skull.  Where the Lidless Eye is varies, but in all cases it is hideous and alien: an unholy testament to your bygone humanity.

## What exactly just happened?

You were wandering alone - either you took a walk through a park, a short cut through an alleyway, or you were alone by a lake - and you thought you heard a whisper.  You paused to confirm, and that moment of hesitation, the world around you swept up in sudden light and you were *suddenly somewhere else*.

You were inside the Operation Chamber of a Star Engine.

## The Star Engines

Each Star Engine was once vessel for one of the many Empires of the Unknowable.  The Empires were ancient intergalactic civilizations, which grew powerful and then eventually fell under the dominion of the Distant Host: colossal, organic, alien proto-Gods.

Once the Star Engines traversed the universe at the command of the Unknowable, but now that those ancient Empires are dead and decaying, the Engines call for help, trying to gradually reinvigorate their missing masters by rebuilding other species into their image.

The Star Engine spoke to you, as you were vivisected, in a series of echoing Whispers.  It told you all of this, and then told you that you were part of that Exquisite Design - you were to stand in the place of this Unknowable race, and become part of the fungal, dimensional machinery they've left behind.

## What now?

You are one of the Engraved, a human repurposed by the indelicate unanesthetized surgery of a Star Engine's operating Chamber.  Whatever your previous life, you now serve the Star Engine and its fallen Unknowable Empire.  Sometimes even willingly, you wage continual galactic war against the grotesque horrors which that empire has left behind.
