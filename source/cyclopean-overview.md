# Overview

You were taken from Earth by an alien machine, only to be sundered alive, and Operated upon.  Your organs were violently pulled from you and then you were _rebuilt_ with a series of Exquisite Apparata.  Now the Apparata are a part of you and fill you with Whispers and strange, incomprehensible memories.

They continually churn and operate inside of you.  You don't eat, sleep or breathe anymore.  You see new, strange, fabrics of reality lain over the familiar everywhere you turn.

Throughout, you did not pass out, did not die - your memories of the entire process are vivid.  It felt like an eternity of dehumanizing pain.  But all of those memories are _internal things_.

There are only two pieces of *external evidence* of your torture and reassembly:

There are the scars where you were pulled apart by the Star Engine - now that you've been drawn back together, those scars bulge with oily, fungal seams.

And there is the Lidless Eye.
