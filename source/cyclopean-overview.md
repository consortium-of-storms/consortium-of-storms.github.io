# Overview


You are a Cyclopean.  You were once human, but that was before a thing you came to know as the Star Engine plucked you from Earth.  Without warning, one day while you were alone (only for a few moments), it plucked you up and swept you through the Fold.  You found yourself deposited, alone, into its desolate and alien chambers.

Your abduction was beyond traumatic: it was beyond any nightmare ever dreamt, more grotesque than any horror movie filmed.  You were spat unceremoniously, clammy with fungal slime, into a biomechanical operating theater in the heart of the Star Engine.  And there you were robbed of your humanity, forever.

## The Engraving

You were restrained with the fleshy embrace of cold, wet fungal lobes within the theater, and then you were constricted until you absolutely still.  You could feel the contours and textures of the living machine, and then shortly after you could feel its sharp devices press into your skin and begin to tear you apart.

Every last moment of this process is seared vividly into your memories, every second of your vivisection.  You remember the sensation of being hollowed out, every obscene organic sound.  You remember when the pulsating mass entered you again, filled you up, and begin to knit you back together.

You don't know why you didn't die.  Did you die?  Are you dead?  Maybe.

There came a point where the cradle you were in stilled for a second or two, and then it began to churn and swirl again.  You were swept up anew, flushed through some sort of channel, and eventually you were vomited out upon the floor of a large, dimly phosphorescent chamber.

Your discarded organs and an impossible amount of blood surrounded you, covering you like the rags which used to be your clothes.  You shook violently with the cold and the shock of the trauma and you stared.

And there, in that low luminescence, in that lonely new biomechanical cavity: that was when you first began to perceive the Unearthly Whispers.  You began to feel the new organs inside of you whirl and churn and _activate_.

It told you that you had survived the Engraving.  It welcomed you back, but from where you don't know.  It said that the time had come to once again face the Unknowable, the _things beyond the Fold of reality_.  It told you its name - it was unpronounceable, save for its honorific: 'of the Star Engines'.  It was a Star Engine.

Whispers of a distant memory infected your mind.  Not your memories, but anothers'.  Was it even your mind anymore?  What had you been infected with?  What had you become?

## The Return

Now, months later, you have returned to Earth from the Star Engine's holding, but things aren't as they once were.  You aren't anything close to human anymore and madness tends to follow you wherever you go.  Your friends and family may have been the first, but they certainly won't be the last.

When you hear stories of alien abduction, your attention perks.  Usually the culprits of these stories are attention seekers, but sometimes _there's something to it_.  Something news of phenomena or curious happenstance are genuinely the touch of the extraterrestrial.  Sometimes it precipitates another who is like you - someone who has been Engraved.  A Cyclopean, one of the Infected.

You know that there are thousands more just like you, others who've been put under an organic imperative to serve the Star Engines.  Like you they are disfigured: though most of you can pass for human fully clothed, you certainly couldn't pass careful scrutiny.

For one, your chest is a lattice of grotesque scars, implementing a curious geometry into your flesh.  It's like a fractal demonstration of a dozen autopsies, and it's only the first of the tangible indications of your post-humanity.  There is so much more evidence of what you are than your scars, though.

There are the Apparata.  They are biomechanical machinery, distant micro-relatives of the massive Star Engine you were born in.  Inside you they unceasingly work - they keep you alive, let you cross into the Fold without dying, and they sometimes _turn you inside out, Inverting you into a completely new being_.

There are the Unearthly Whispers.  This is the living voice of the fungal symbiote you've been coupled with.  It is an actual living part of you now and it has a will which neighbors your own.  It speaks to you, it overlays the fabric of other realities on your vision, it warns you of danger and tells you secrets, and you're pretty sure that it _slowly drives the people around you mad_.

And there is the Lidless Eye.
