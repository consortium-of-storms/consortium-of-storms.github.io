# Overview


You are a Cyclopean.  You were once human, but that was before a thing you came to know as the Star Engine plucked you from Earth.  Without warning, one day while you were alone (only for a few moments), it plucked you up and swept you through the Fold.  You found yourself deposited, alone, into its desolate and alien chambers.

Your abduction was beyond traumatic: it was beyond any nightmare ever dreamt, more grotesque than any horror movie filmed.  You were spat unceremoniously, clammy with fungal slime, into a biomechanical operating theater in the heart of the Star Engine.  And there you were robbed of your humanity, forever.
