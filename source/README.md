# An Evening of Storms

We have enclosed for your consideration several books about a world of the surreal and unknowable, a world like ours but reflected and skewed.  It is a world where eyes stare in the dark, and bleak things twist in the distant voids between the stars.

This world is the setting of an unending series of stories, except that in this case, the stories are something which you'll create, yourself.  The settings are merely scaffolds for you to hang anything you like.  Most importantly, the characters are yours, and so are the decisions they make and the consequences they earn.

Each Evening Time volume is a playbook which depicts a different part of a big, elaborate tapestry - something which features the grand in equal measure with the macabre.  With each playbook you'll be given a new framework through which you can pour yourself into the exploration of this world.  You'll see firsthand the things we and others have made for you, and through them you'll see yourself.

Evening Time books are a set of manuals which assemble into a tabletop roleplaying game.  Using what you'll find in each playbook, you and yours can turn any normal evening into something _else_, a narrative which everyone builds together.  In the case of Evening Time, the narrative is one where you all travel through a dusky world of shadows and entities from beyond.

The central purpose of an Evening Time game is to define an easy to play and remember system which defines success and failure, and then step into the background of your own narrative.  The goal is to empower your stories.  You should be able to play anywhere, with anyone, at any time.

But of course the best time to tell stories has always been after dark.
