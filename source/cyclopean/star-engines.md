## The Star Engines

The Star Engines are a powerful fleet of supersentient biomechanical planets.  Each one is vast even in our reality, but their form doesn't stop there: they expand in every direction and dimension, each one stretching deep within the reaches of the Fold.

The Star Engines were originally instrumented and grown by the Distant Powers, an unimaginably old alien empire.  Over hundreds of thousands of years they were deliberately evolved and augmented, until they had become the primary home and means of conquest for the empire.

### Symbiosis and Evolution

Over this long stretch of time a symbiosis began to emerge between the Star Engines and the Distant Powers.  The Star Engines became a massive host and advisory system, guarding and furthering the Powers.  In exchange, the Powers would provide supplicants to the Star Engines: members of the empire which would willingly submit for Engraving, and become living portions of the Star Engine's complex internal systems.

Indeed, the Distant Powers had even begun to evolve over time so that supplication into the machinery of the Star Engines was something that their body and mind could handle painlessly.  To become a supplicant was a great honor and many strove for it, not in the least because the Engraving bestowed transcendent ability on any who partook.

Distinct purposes were assigned to each supplicant dependent on their ability, and according to their will.  These were the Exquisite Designs: singular purposes which resulted from a particular combination of Apparata.

Every design was specifically suited to integration into the Star Engine in a different way.  Entire colonies of a particular design would inhabit the Engine in regions bent to their particular purpose - defensive systems, navigation systems, and so on.  These colonies became the functional empowerment of their particular Star Engine, a synthesis between fungal biomachinery and living will.

Over time, each Star Engine began to breed its own phenotype of Apparata, as the colonies and their descendants evolved more and more in the internal ecosystem of their particular home Engine.  Cultures of colonies became diverse across the Engines but homogenous within each particular Star Engine; the Distant Powers progressed into many subspecies as they spread inexorably between galaxies and into the Fold.

### The Consequence of Exploration

Each Star Engine used the technology of the Fold to whisper to one another, and every Engraved supplicant perceived these Whispers.  And so, like drifting clouds of fungal spores, the Star Engines numbering in the thousands floated through the stars.  Cloud fleets of the supersentient ecosystems swept across the universe, exploring every stretch of the vastness and every indescribable corner of the Fold.

Then there came a day when a distant cloud of Star Engines emitted in unison one sudden distress cry and were cut off: vanished into the horizons of the Fold.  It had all happened in an eyeblink, with no warning or time for reaction.  First the exploratory cloud was there in the far frontiers, and then they simply _weren't_.

For a time the other Star Engines in the surviving clouds were quiet with shock, and then they converged with curiosity.  Limbs of the drifting empire began to shift course and navigate towards the site of the lost cloud.  The hope was to rescue or save the lost Engines, but upon arriving, the Distant Powers found something far more horrible than they had expected.

### The Breach and the Unknowable

A section of the Fold had collapsed, and at its core there was nothing, _nothing at all_.  At least, at first.  But then, from the depths of the void, tendrils began to snake forth, grasping at the edges of the Fold and pulsating along the seam of existence.  The Unknowable had found their way into the Fold, and through it, reality.

The Unknowable, as best as the Distant Powers were ever able to learn, were creatures of an inside-out relationship with _being_.  Hypothesis of all sorts would be offered by the suddenly threatened empire, but nothing was ever to be proven.

Unbound by physical law or even the transcendental geometry of the Fold, the Unknowable were something else entirely.  Something wholly beyond the horizons of reason.  But more importantly than all of that, the Unknowable were first and foremost _hungry_, and they sprawled forth from the original breach at a striking pace, quickly consuming the first clouds of Star Engines in hours in a pulsing, barely perceptible bulge of Unknowable void tissues.

The moment of the Breach precipitated a coming war between the Distant Powers and the Unknowable.  It was a struggle for dominance as much as survival, and it became a primeval thing, spanning generations of the empire.  It was a war which would last tens of thousands of years, and eventually consume the entire empire and almost all of its glorious invention and history.

### The Void Engines

Most wars are told in a series of sagas, long struggles interleaved with pivotal moments of change in the turmoil.  One of those moments came for the ten thousand year war with the emergence of the Void Engines.  It came from the Breach, the place in the far horizons where the Unknowable had originally discovered the Fold.

A chilling signal, an obscene perversion of the Whispers, began to emit from  beyond the Breach.  Soon after the Obscene Whispers came, so too did the Void Engines.

Wrought upon the carapace and bio-matter of the originally consumed Star Engines, the Void Engines were violated, decrepit hulks formed of the gestalt of imperial dead matter and Unknowable void tissues.  The union of the Star Engines and the monsters beyond reality.

### The Turning Point

Bleak mirrors of the Distant Powers, the unsettling return of the lost engines in this perverse capacity could have been the final pivotal moment of the conflict, except for a grave mistake on the part of the Unknowable.  What was first a deeply unsettling experience - the pollution of the communications network all of the Star Engines and Distant Powers relied upon - became an exploitable point of knowledge for the remnants of the Empire.

What actually ended the war isn't widely known, as its effects were devastating beyond all expectation.  The Star Engines which remain to this day only survived because they were far enough from the event horizon of what is known as the Sealing.

This is what is known: two names.  Epachaneyon and Luphaion.

### Epachaneyon and Luphaion

Epachaneyon was one of the most massive of the Star Engines, and also one of the foremost explorer cultures.  Epachaneyon had been one of the Engines which had vanished in the Breach, and it had been one of the first Void Engines who had returned, blasphemed by the Unknowable.

Luphaion had been the first Star Engine to attempt communication with the Void Engines.  It had emerged from one of the closest battle formations, and hurtled itself into the depths of the approaching Void Engine cloud, emitting a maddened and incoherent distressful cry.

The remaining Star Engines each say the same thing.  The story goes that they heard confused Whispers from the Star Engines on the battlefront.  The Whispers were as followed:

"Luphaion?"

And, then, after a moment, "Epachaneyon?"

And then there was a devastating wave of feedback and disruption, shattering the consciousness of the Star Engines and casting them adrift in the cosmos for eons.

### Reawakening

In time, the surviving Star Engines began to rewaken, but to a horrible half-existence.  In their comatose state, the Distant Powers, empires which had so wholly relied on the Star Engines to thrive, had been without one half of their equation.  They had been abandoned to their fate, and to this day the Star Engines do not know if any survived or fled.

Where there were once entire sporelike clouds fleets of the living supersentient vessels, only six remained after the reawakening.  They were: Aqatarid, Jayanoth, Myacenid, Qia'amon, Shanaoth, and Veya'raj.  At least, those were the only ones capable of hearing or responding to the Whispers.

Without their inhabitant colonies to populate them, the Star Engines had no way to perceive the cosmos.  They had no way to navigate it, no way to propel at all.  They were forever adrift in total sensory deprivation, with only one another to speak to.  Who knows how long they floated through space, nothing but cold and dreaming hulks?

Then, one day, a few million years before humanity was born, one of the Star Engines met the gravitational force of a young golden star, was pulled into orbit, and eventually collided with one of its planets and perished.  This was Jayanoth, and the planet was Earth.

### Discovering Earth

In so many ways everything is small and random when put against a cosmic scale, and the Star Engines, massive and supersentience as they are, are no different.  
The collision of Jayanoth and Earth was a truly random event, and though it meant the loss of yet another of the Star Engines, something else curious began to occur: Jayanoth's mighty corpse decomposed on Earth, but its fungal composition found Earth very warm and hospitable.

Soon the corpse matter of Jayanoth had spread and evolved and coated much of the planet in its fungal tissues.  The mushroom descendants of Jayanoth's once majestic architecture can be seen almost anywhere on the planet.  Like so much starborn phenomena when it meets Earth, the grand history of this fungus has been subsumed, and become part of everyday life for the inhabitants of the planet.

This has had an interesting side-effect: Earth has become perceptible and observable for the remaining Star Engines.  And although they cannot communicate with poor dead Jayanoth anymore, his collision did leave an anchor point in the Fold through which the Star Engines can reach out us, and call out to us, and eventually even pluck us away.

### Humanity

The Star Engines have been plucking humans into the Fold for longer than recorded history, but their experiments did not immediately result in Cyclopeans like the modern Infected.

The process of Engraving was, all in all, designed entirely in a way which was suitable to the Distant Powers - a race which had symbiotically evolved to be amenable to the Engraving.  The same process, innocent with that symbiotic race, is devastating for a human.

Most of the first waves of Cyclopeans were disasters or outright casualties - even the successful primeval Cyclopeans were monstrous and unspeakable, and some of those still roam the darker reaches of the Fold, immortal and anguished.

Subsequent waves of Cyclopeans were generational increments of subtle improvement, each slightly less traumatized, mad and grotesque.  And with each wave, the unsympathetic Star Engines grow slightly more capable and slightly more aware.

Human tissues and fungal tissues have an inherently non-symbiotic interaction.  For humans, the Engraving is not an honor - it is a traumatic, consuming Infection of elaborate sentient molds.  The human tissues struggle eternally to reject the fungus they play host to.

Pragmatically, although the process of Engraving has been thoroughly refined over the last ten thousand years, there are still dire consequences.

For one, almost all Cyclopeans eventually go mad or incoherent.  The fungal tissues aside, there is an incubating insanity which boils at the edge of the human psyche every time it experiences the Fold and every time it hears the Unearthly Whispers.

This madness isn't confined to the Cyclopeans, either.  Everywhere a Cyclopean goes, the fold is just a tiny bit easier to perceive.  This is a hellish, unsettling experience for any human: glimpses of impossible geometry, spatial incoherence, and monstrous Fold creatures or their obscene tissues.

History is littered with cautionary tales of seeking the Unknowable, and though the Fold and the Star Engines are the natural enemies of the _actual_ Unknowable, to humanity there is no practical distinction.

### The Edge of the Fold

Around three thousand years ago, the Star Engines hit something of a tipping point in their efforts to restore their colonies to health through the abduction of the Infected.  They restored enough of their sensory systems to look at the horizons of the Fold again, to watch again for the old enemy of the Distant Powers.

The vision that they shared was one they feared but did not fully understand.  At the site of the Breach, the nothingness was bigger than ever - but the tendrils of the Unknowable were not immediately discernible.

Instead, floating in front of the breach was a massive, grotesque oblong shape, writhing with strange Unknowable iconography and spiraling tendrils of nonexistence.  The shape bulged and contracted, threatening to burst without quite doing it.  The gravity of what they were looking at was clear.

It was a massive struggling cloud of Void Engines, Epachaneyon and Luphaion at its center, locked together in an unholy, silent struggle.

### Preparations

Now the Star Engines have redoubled their effort.  They are Infecting more humans than ever before, in a near panic to shore up their numbers before the Void Engines can cease their struggle and return their attention to the rest of the Fold.

Every day, more signs of the tide of this distant struggle and its outcome emerge: increasingly, small pits of Unknowable things open up and spill, bilious with void as though it were amniotic fluid, into the Fold.

Despite the traumatic experience of the Engraving, it's very common for Cyclopeans to eventually succumb to the warnings and Whispers of the Star Engines.  For one, the Apparata and the Whispers subtly bend the consciousness of the Cyclopeans to the Star Engines' will - for another, the Unknowable are clearly a threat to existence if left unchecked.

And so the Infected have become a willing hand in the Star Engine's plans.  In order to save the universe from the Unknowable, first they must Infect the Earth, and then they must Infect the cosmos.
