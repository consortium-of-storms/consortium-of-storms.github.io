## What exactly just happened?

You were wandering alone - either you took a walk through a park, a short cut through an alleyway, or you were alone by a lake - and you thought you heard a whisper.  You paused to confirm, and that moment of hesitation, the world around you swept up in sudden light and you were *suddenly somewhere else*.

You were inside the Operation Chamber of a Star Engine.
