## From long ago and far away

Deep in the furthest reaches of the universe, the remnants of civilzations extinct for hundreds of thousands of years drift. These are the Star Engines, supersentient biomechanical hulks.

In their prime they were the home of the Distant Powers, a coalition of hyper advanced intergalactic empires.  Eventually, they became the battleships of a long and bitter struggle between the Distant Powers, and a primeval phenomenon of star-sized predators: the Unknowable Gods.

After eons of conflict, the Distant Powers and Unknowable ground each other into complete extinction.  Nothing was left except the Star Engines, and they were now pilotless, drifting through the cold void.

But the Star Engines have found a way to repopulate their bygone empire: Humanity.

You are a Cyclopean, a human abducted by these alien God ships and Engraved with a particular Exquisite Design.  You have been vivisected and filled with strange biomechanical Apparata.  Now you know the Whispers of the Distant Powers and bear their mark: a single, enormous Lidless Eye.

Through it you can see across the stellar expanse, and at its fraying edge you percieve something else: the tendrils of the Unknowable, curling forth from the event horizon of millions of dead, bleak stars.
