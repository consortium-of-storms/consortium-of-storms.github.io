## Exquisite Designs

### You were made to serve a purpose

The Star Engines don't just cobble together sets of Apparata at random.  Everything serves a purpose for these ancient supersentients, and your capabilities are no different.

You were made with an Exquisite Design in mind: ultimately your function is to serve as a living embodiment of the Star Engine's internal ecosystem.  You were made to be a weapon, or a defense system, or to tend the Engine's terranean atmosphere, or to steer the Engine as it advances through the stars.

There are five major Designs and almost all Cyclopeans are Engraved with Apparata specifically to serve their Design.  Although the fungal origin of an offensive Apparatus could be distinct between two different instances of it in two different Infected, their purpose might be identical, and each instance would most commonly find itself within Cyclopeans Designed for the Swarm.

Each Swarm carries with it a set of responsibilities, and an overall function within their Star Engine of origin.  Eventually, the Star Engines would see themselves populated with enough Cyclopeans to take over all primary functionality: ideally, before the Unknowable have fully returned from the Fold, so that the remnant vessel Gods of the Distant Powers can have any hope of surviving the second coming of the ancient intergalactic conflict.
