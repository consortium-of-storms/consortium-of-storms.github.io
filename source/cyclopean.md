# Cyclopean: The Host

A human: dismantled, vivisected, and reborn into a grotesque supernatural thing.  Cyclopeans are forever Graven by the Exquisite Design of their Distant Host, Warped in unspeakable ways to serve as living pieces of a massive alien Star Engine.  Every Cyclopean is Warped according to their Design or Engraving, except for one Warping, common to all Cyclopeans: an enormous Lidless Eye.  It is through the Eye which their new fungal Gods curiously peer.
