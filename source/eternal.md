# Eternal: The Assembly

Grim reapers given human personification, Doomed to wander the many worlds forever, compelled by the Assembly to the worst points of human and global disaster and bear Witness to the fallen.  Every Eternal harbors a collection of Witnessed souls, building a vast pool of Gravitas, which they channel through use of Symbols, physical objects which they are forever linked to.
