# Introduction

You were taken from Earth by an alien machine, only to be sundered alive.  Your organs were violently pulled from you and then you were _infected_ with a series of vile living Apparatus.  Now the Apparata are a part of you and fill you with Whispers and strange, incomprehensible memories.

You are one of the Infected, a human remade by the indelicate unanesthetized surgery of a Star Engine.  You've gone through the Crucible, and now you're filled with a grotesque alien fungus in place of your vital organs.

No matter what part of you the bizarre automatic operating table extracted, you did not pass out, did not die - your memories of the entire process are vivid.  It felt like an eternity of dehumanizing pain.  But all of those memories are _internal things_.

There are only two pieces of *external evidence* of your torture and reassembly:

* There is the scars where you were pulled apart by the Star Engine - now that you've been drawn back together, those scars bulge with oily, fungal seams.

* And there is the Lidless Eye.

It is the only thing you and all of the other Infected have in common:  One single, massive, palm-sized Lidless Eye.  You can even see through it, and so can whatever now forever Whispers in your skull.  Where the Lidless Eye is varies, but in all cases it is hideous and alien: an unholy testament to your bygone humanity.

## What exactly just happened?

You were wandering alone - either you took a walk through a park, a short cut through an alleyway, or you were alone by a lake - and you thought you heard a whisper.  You paused to confirm, and that moment of hesitation, the world around you swept up in sudden light and you were *suddenly somewhere else*.

## The Star Engines

Each Star Engine was once vessel to the Unknowable, servants of the Distant Host.  In the eras since the Unknowable have vanished, the Star Engines themselves have begun to reach out desperately to any life they can contact, Infecting living creatures with the spoor of a Forbidden One in hopes that the Infested will repopulate the once great cities.
