# Introduction

Cyclopean is a game of ancient alien horrors.  In it, we take control of humans who have been claimed by strange and mad alien technology, turned into living machine components of supersentient biomechanical planets.

These planets, the Star Engines, were made hundreds of thousands of years ago by a collective of empires called the Distant Powers.  Eventually the Distant Powers fell to a war against megalithic entities called the Unknowable, and now their Star Engines are all that is left.

For so long, the Star Engines have been inert, drifting through the cosmos like frozen hulks.  But around fifty thousand years ago, they began to reawaken and cry out in distress across the void to dead empires which were no longer listening.

In some ways the Star Engines are like the God-Machine, except that they have no thriving world to hide within, and no legion of angels to command around.  They awoke desolate and abandoned, stranded in the cosmos.

That's where Cyclopeans come in: while the Star Engines had no inbuilt legion, they did have the means to discover and contact planets across the universe.  In their hunt, they found many inhabited worlds, including Earth; their first attempts to contact us arrived before the dawn of our history, but only recently have the Cyclopeans begun to appear.

The Cyclopeans bear a grim secret, which is that they are to the last Infected unwillingly by the Star Engines, and now they are reborn with a strange new insidious and alien intellect. You are a Cyclopean: a human reborn in the service of a Star Engine.

Unfortunately, time is growing short for the Star Engines to achieve the means of their own rebirth.  In the first throes of their reawakening, in the original distress calls sent across the void, the Star Engines inadvertently reached the attention of the Unknowable.

After the ruin of the Distant Powers, the Unknowable had shied deep into the Fold, places in the universe where pockets of our reality and into other eternities.  But the distress beacons of the Star Engines have caught their attention, and now their tendrils snake back around the edges of existence to finish the job once and for all.

In their blind grasping at our universe to locate the Star Engines, the Unknowable have found something else: our planet, Earth.  Sick with the spoor of the Infected, Earth has become the first target of the Unknowable, and the Star Engines flood your perception with their Unearthly Whispers - warning you of that which comes.
