# Introduction

Cyclopean is a game of ancient alien horrors.  In it, we take control of humans who have been claimed by strange and mad alien technology, turned into living machine components of supersentient biomechanical planets.

These planets, the Star Engines, were made hundreds of thousands of years ago by a collective of empires called the Distant Powers.  Eventually the Distant Powers fell to a war against megalithic entities called the Unknowable, and now their Star Engines are all that is left.

For so long, the Star Engines have been inert, drifting through the cosmos like frozen hulks.  But around fifty thousand years ago, they began to reawaken and cry out in distress across the void to Empires that were no longer listening.

In some ways the Star Engines are like the God-Machine, except that they have no thriving world to hide within, and no legion of angels to command around.

That's where Cyclopeans come in: where the Star Engines have no legion, they have discovered Earth, and now they collude to infect the Earth's people with their strange organic machinery.

You are a Cyclopean: a human reborn in the service of a Star Engine.

Unfortunately, for so long the Star Engines were adrift, they escaped notice of the Unknowable.  That is no longer true: since the distress cries of the Engines have gone out, the Unknowable have reawakened.

Now they hunt down the Star Engines, seeking to eradicate the last remnants of the Distant Powers once and for all.  Because of you and your new Infected Empires, the Earth has become their latest target.
