# Lich: The Radiance

Thousands of years ago in South America, there was a forgotten culture which observed ritual worship of the Envoy: extradimensional beings phosphorescent with Radiance.  Amongst these rituals were the Birth Rites of Black Suns, where a human, sacrificed and drained of blood, would be resurrected as a Lich - an undying thing filled with a Radiant Ichor.  To this day, Liches pursue an agenda from Beyond, obeying an unearthly Compulsion - enacting Astrological magics with dark Grandeur.
