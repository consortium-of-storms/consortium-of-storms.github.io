# Design Problems, Thoughts and Notes

* Liches have no enemy / antagonist system right now
* Cyclopeans have no enemy / antagonist system right now
* Cyclopeans should morph (they are Power Rangers)
* It's not obvious that Cyclopeans are star engines
* Eternals have a Yearning for the Gravitas of souls.  This causes them to hunt one another.
* Eternals have a Calling, the type of cataclysm they are fond of.  They feel that cataclysm coming.
* If Eternals stay too long in one area, their Calling inflicts a Cataclysm.
* Eternals should have types determined by their Calling / Eternity.  An Eternity is one of the 5 afterlives: Reincarnation, Oblivion, Heaven, Hell, and ???
* What is the 5th afterlife?
* What are the 5 types of Callings for Eternals?
* No practical idea what the 5 types of Liches or their alliances are
* What are the 5 types of Cyclopeans?  What are Cyclopean orders like?
* I dig the idea of Spoor as a Cyclopean or Lich stat but I don't know what should be used to do.  It's basically a "stank" rating of some sort.
