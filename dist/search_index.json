These are the Star Engines, supersentient biomechanical hulks.\nIn their prime they were the home of the Distant Powers, a coalition of hyper advanced intergalactic empires.  Eventually, they became the battleships of a long and bitter struggle between the Distant Powers, and a primeval phenomenon of star-sized predators: the Unknowable Gods.\nAfter eons of conflict, the Distant Powers and Unknowable ground each other into complete extinction.  Nothing was left except the Star Engines, and they were now pilotless, drifting through the cold void.\nBut the Star Engines have found a way to repopulate their bygone empire: Humanity.\nYou are a Cyclopean, a human abducted by these alien God ships and Engraved with a particular Exquisite Design.  You have been vivisected and filled with strange biomechanical Apparata.  Now you know the Whispers of the Distant Powers and bear their mark: a single, enormous Lidless Eye.\nThrough it you can see across the stellar expanse, and at its fraying edge you percieve something else: the tendrils of the Unknowable, curling forth from the event horizon of millions of dead, bleak stars.\nAs a Cyclopean, you will\n\nCradle within your human husk a grotesque array of alien Apparata.\nPerceive the fabric of Unearthly Whispers which overlay reality.\nAssume your Inversion, a warped, monstrous alien self.\nServe and occupy the Star Engines: vast supersentient primeval husks of ancient civilization, drifting hollow through the void of space.\nStruggle against the approaching monstrous agents of the Unknowable.\nBegin the process of fashioning the Earth anew, infecting it with the dread machinery of the Distant Powers.\n\n"},"cyclopean-introduction.html":{"url":"cyclopean-introduction.html","title":"Introduction","body":"Introduction\nCyclopean is a game of ancient alien horrors.  In it, we take control of humans who have been claimed by strange and mad alien technology, turned into living machine components of supersentient biomechanical planets.\nThese planets, the Star Engines, were made hundreds of thousands of years ago by a collective of empires called the Distant Powers.  Eventually the Distant Powers fell to a war against megalithic entities called the Unknowable, and now their Star Engines are all that is left.\nFor so long, the Star Engines have been inert, drifting through the cosmos like frozen hulks.  But around fifty thousand years ago, they began to reawaken and cry out in distress across the void to dead empires which were no longer listening.\nIn some ways the Star Engines are like the God-Machine, except that they have no thriving world to hide within, and no legion of angels to command around.  They awoke desolate and abandoned, stranded in the cosmos.\nThat&#39;s where Cyclopeans come in: while the Star Engines had no inbuilt legion, they did have the means to discover and contact planets across the universe.  In their hunt, they found many inhabited worlds, including Earth; their first attempts to contact us arrived before the dawn of our history, but only recently have the Cyclopeans begun to appear.\nThe Cyclopeans bear a grim secret, which is that they are to the last Infected unwillingly by the Star Engines, and now they are reborn with a strange new insidious and alien intellect. You are a Cyclopean: a human reborn in the service of a Star Engine.\nUnfortunately, time is growing short for the Star Engines to achieve the means of their own rebirth.  In the first throes of their reawakening, in the original distress calls sent across the void, the Star Engines inadvertently reached the attention of the Unknowable.\nAfter the ruin of the Distant Powers, the Unknowable had shied deep into the Fold, places in the universe where pockets of our reality and into other eternities.  But the distress beacons of the Star Engines have caught their attention, and now their tendrils snake back around the edges of existence to finish the job once and for all.\nIn their blind grasping at our universe to locate the Star Engines, the Unknowable have found something else: our planet, Earth.  Sick with the spoor of the Infected, Earth has become the first target of the Unknowable, and the Star Engines flood your perception with their Unearthly Whispers - warning you of that which comes.\n"},"cyclopean-overview.html":{"url":"cyclopean-overview.html","title":"Overview","body":"Overview\nYou are a Cyclopean.

Without warning, one day while you were alone (only for a few moments), it plucked you up and swept you through the Fold.  You found yourself deposited, alone, into its desolate and alien chambers.\nYour abduction was beyond traumatic: it was beyond any nightmare ever dreamt, more grotesque than any horror movie filmed.  You were spat unceremoniously, clammy with fungal slime, into a biomechanical operating theater in the heart of the Star Engine.  And there you were robbed of your humanity, forever.\nWhat exactly just happened?\nYou were only alone for a few moments, but that&#39;s all it took.  You could have been out for a walk, you could have stepped into the next room, you could have been driving home late.  It doesn&#39;t really matter: everywhere you were, you were unknowingly surrounded by the Fold, and the instruments of the Star Engines reached from afar and took you.\nThe first thing you experienced was a subtle weight in the air around you, and then things began to go wrong, one by one.  Your radio was overtaken by static, all of the animals dropped silent, or cars began to sputter out and stop around you until everything was still.\nA maddening glimpse of the Fold came next: you saw the world yawn wide, expanding to show you its fifth and sixth and seventh extradimensional corners, and you learned that the world you used to know was just a fraction of something greater.  It was just a small slice of the pie of reality.\nAnd then, the next moment, a blinding luminescence with no imaginable origin blanketed everything.  You felt a jerk in the pit of your stomach, as if you were being tugged along by something which had a firm grip on the inside of your gut.\nWhen the light cleared, you were somewhere different, somewhere which didn&#39;t even resemble the unfolded new corners of the place you&#39;d been just moments before.  You were somewhere which looked like a planet, except black and lonely, composed of impossible geometry that challenged and warped your perception with features that simply could not be.\nYou didn&#39;t know it then, but this was the surface of a Star Engine.  Frost covered everything, but the winds that swept by seared your skin and shredded your clothes with blinding heat.  You were suddenly gasping for air, in agony - as though you stood within a great, vast void.  And, of course, you did.\nThen the surface of the Star Engine broke beneath you and a column of light burst from beneath its crust.  The ground pulsed and swelled and came alive, splitting apart to digest you whole, then pass you to your next destination: the operating theater to be pulled open and Engraved.\nThe Engraving\nYou were restrained with the fleshy embrace of cold, wet fungal lobes within the theater, and then you were constricted until you absolutely still.  You could feel the contours and textures of the living machine, and then shortly after you could feel its sharp devices press into your skin and begin to tear you apart.\nEvery last moment of this process is seared vividly into your memories, every second of your vivisection.  You remember the sensation of being hollowed out, every obscene organic sound.  You remember when the pulsating mass entered you again, filled you up, and begin to knit you back together.\nYou don&#39;t know why you didn&#39;t die.  Did you die?  Are you dead?  Maybe.\nThere came a point where the cradle you were in stilled for a second or two, and then it began to churn and swirl again.  You were swept up anew, flushed through some sort of channel, and eventually you were vomited out upon the floor of a large, dimly phosphorescent chamber.\nYour discarded organs and an impossible amount of blood surrounded you, covering you like the rags which used to be your clothes.  You shook violently with the cold and the shock of the trauma and you stared.\nAnd there, in that low luminescence, in that lonely new biomechanical cavity: that was when you first began to perceive the Unearthly Whispers.  You began to feel the new organs inside of you whirl and churn and activate.\nIt told you that you had survived the Engraving.  It welcomed you back, but from where you don&#39;t know.  It said that the time had come to once again face the Unknowable, the things beyond the Fold of reality.  It told you its name - it was unpronounceable, save for its honorific: &#39;of the Star Engines&#39;.  It was a Star Engine.\nWhispers of a distant memory infected your mind.  Not your memories, but anothers&#39;.  Was it even your mind anymore?  What had you been infected with?  What had you become?\nThe Return\nNow, months later, you have returned to Earth from the Star Engine&#39;s holding, but things aren&#39;t as they once were.  You aren&#39;t anything close to human anymore and madness tends to follow you wherever you go.  Your friends and family may have been the first, but they certainly won&#39;t be the last.\nWhen you hear stories of alien abduction, your attention perks.  Usually the culprits of these stories are attention seekers, but sometimes there&#39;s something to it.  Something news of phenomena or curious happenstance are genuinely the touch of the extraterrestrial.  Sometimes it precipitates another who is like you - someone who has been Engraved.  A Cyclopean, one of the Infected.\nYou know that there are thousands more just like you, others who&#39;ve been put under an organic imperative to serve the Star Engines.  Like you they are disfigured: though most of you can pass for human fully clothed, you certainly couldn&#39;t pass careful scrutiny.\nFor one, your chest is a lattice of grotesque scars, implementing a curious geometry into your flesh.  It&#39;s like a fractal demonstration of a dozen autopsies, and it&#39;s only the first of the tangible indications of your post-humanity.  There is so much more evidence of what you are than your scars, though.\nThere are the Apparata.  They are biomechanical machinery, distant micro-relatives of the massive Star Engine you were born in.  Inside you they unceasingly work - they keep you alive, let you cross into the Fold without dying, and they sometimes turn you inside out, Inverting you into a completely new being.\nThere are the Unearthly Whispers.  This is the living voice of the fungal symbiote you&#39;ve been coupled with.  It is an actual living part of you now and it has a will which neighbors your own.  It speaks to you, it overlays the fabric of other realities on your vision, it warns you of danger and tells you secrets, and you&#39;re pretty sure that it slowly drives the people around you mad.\nAnd there is the Lidless Eye.\nThe Lidless Eye\nIt&#39;s the only thing which you and all of the other Infected share in common: a single palm-sized Lidless Eye.  It peers around of its own free will, a horrific veined, too-detailed orb which seems almost completely impervious to harm.  Its black pupil expands and contracts in maddening syncopation with any stimuli.\nYou can peer through it, and in uncovering it you amplify the strength of your Unearthly Whispers while at the same time you expose the nature of your posthumanity.  Maybe you&#39;re hesitant to, though - because what else could be looking through it?  It isn&#39;t always you that controls where it peers.\nThere are many locations where the Eye emerges, but there are five places which are the most common:\n\nThe forehead\nThe throat\nThe chest\nThe upper back\nThe abdomen\n\nStill, some have it upon their shoulders, some within their palms, and some have more than one.  But most of the Infected have a single eye, centrally aligned with the spinal column.\nIn all cases the Lidless Eye is obscene, hideous and alien: it is an unholy thing which lays bare the lie of reality for any who see it, and emits pure madness in concentrated, erratic waves.\nThe Star Engines\nThe Star Engines are a powerful fleet of supersentient biomechanical planets.  Each one is vast even in our reality, but their form doesn&#39;t stop there: they expand in every direction and dimension, each one stretching deep within the reaches of the Fold.\nThe Star Engines were originally instrumented and grown by the Distant Powers, an unimaginably old alien empire.  Over hundreds of thousands of years they were deliberately evolved and augmented, until they had become the primary home and means of conquest for the empire.\nSymbiosis and Evolution\nOver this long stretch of time a symbiosis began to emerge between the Star Engines and the Distant Powers.  The Star Engines became a massive host and advisory system, guarding and furthering the Powers.  In exchange, the Powers would provide supplicants to the Star Engines: members of the empire which would willingly submit for Engraving, and become living portions of the Star Engine&#39;s complex internal systems.\nIndeed, the Distant Powers had even begun to evolve over time so that supplication into the machinery of the Star Engines was something that their body and mind could handle painlessly.  To become a supplicant was a great honor and many strove for it, not in the least because the Engraving bestowed transcendent ability on any who partook.\nDistinct purposes were assigned to each supplicant dependent on their ability, and according to their will.  These were the Exquisite Designs: singular purposes which resulted from a particular combination of Apparata.\nEvery design was specifically suited to integration into the Star Engine in a different way.  Entire colonies of a particular design would inhabit the Engine in regions bent to their particular purpose - defensive systems, navigation systems, and so on.  These colonies became the functional empowerment of their particular Star Engine, a synthesis between fungal biomachinery and living will.\nOver time, each Star Engine began to breed its own phenotype of Apparata, as the colonies and their descendants evolved more and more in the internal ecosystem of their particular home Engine.  Cultures of colonies became diverse across the Engines but homogenous within each particular Star Engine; the Distant Powers progressed into many subspecies as they spread inexorably between galaxies and into the Fold.\nThe Consequence of Exploration\nEach Star Engine used the technology of the Fold to whisper to one another, and every Engraved supplicant perceived these Whispers.  And so, like drifting clouds of fungal spores, the Star Engines numbering in the thousands floated through the stars.  Cloud fleets of the supersentient ecosystems swept across the universe, exploring every stretch of the vastness and every indescribable corner of the Fold.\nThen there came a day when a distant cloud of Star Engines emitted in unison one sudden distress cry and were cut off: vanished into the horizons of the Fold.  It had all happened in an eyeblink, with no warning or time for reaction.  First the exploratory cloud was there in the far frontiers, and then they simply weren&#39;t.\nFor a time the other Star Engines in the surviving clouds were quiet with shock, and then they converged with curiosity.  Limbs of the drifting empire began to shift course and navigate towards the site of the lost cloud.  The hope was to rescue or save the lost Engines, but upon arriving, the Distant Powers found something far more horrible than they had expected.\nThe Breach and the Unknowable\nA section of the Fold had collapsed, and at its core there was nothing, nothing at all.  At least, at first.  But then, from the depths of the void, tendrils began to snake forth, grasping at the edges of the Fold and pulsating along the seam of existence.  The Unknowable had found their way into the Fold, and through it, reality.\nThe Unknowable, as best as the Distant Powers were ever able to learn, were creatures of an inside-out relationship with being.  Hypothesis of all sorts would be offered by the suddenly threatened empire, but nothing was ever to be proven.\nUnbound by physical law or even the transcendental geometry of the Fold, the Unknowable were something else entirely.  Something wholly beyond the horizons of reason.  But more importantly than all of that, the Unknowable were first and foremost hungry, and they sprawled forth from the original breach at a striking pace, quickly consuming the first clouds of Star Engines in hours in a pulsing, barely perceptible bulge of Unknowable void tissues.\nThe moment of the Breach precipitated a coming war between the Distant Powers and the Unknowable.  It was a struggle for dominance as much as survival, and it became a primeval thing, spanning generations of the empire.  It was a war which would last tens of thousands of years, and eventually consume the entire empire and almost all of its glorious invention and history.\nThe Void Engines\nMost wars are told in a series of sagas, long struggles interleaved with pivotal moments of change in the turmoil.  One of those moments came for the ten thousand year war with the emergence of the Void Engines.  It came from the Breach, the place in the far horizons where the Unknowable had originally discovered the Fold.\nA chilling signal, an obscene perversion of the Whispers, began to emit from  beyond the Breach.  Soon after the Obscene Whispers came, so too did the Void Engines.\nWrought upon the carapace and bio-matter of the originally consumed Star Engines, the Void Engines were violated, decrepit hulks formed of the gestalt of imperial dead matter and Unknowable void tissues.  The union of the Star Engines and the monsters beyond reality.\nThe Turning Point\nBleak mirrors of the Distant Powers, the unsettling return of the lost engines in this perverse capacity could have been the final pivotal moment of the conflict, except for a grave mistake on the part of the Unknowable.  What was first a deeply unsettling experience - the pollution of the communications network all of the Star Engines and Distant Powers relied upon - became an exploitable point of knowledge for the remnants of the Empire.\nWhat actually ended the war isn&#39;t widely known, as its effects were devastating beyond all expectation.  The Star Engines which remain to this day only survived because they were far enough from the event horizon of what is known as the Sealing.\nThis is what is known: two names.  Epachaneyon and Luphaion.\nEpachaneyon and Luphaion\nEpachaneyon was one of the most massive of the Star Engines, and also one of the foremost explorer cultures.  Epachaneyon had been one of the Engines which had vanished in the Breach, and it had been one of the first Void Engines who had returned, blasphemed by the Unknowable.\nLuphaion had been the first Star Engine to attempt communication with the Void Engines.  It had emerged from one of the closest battle formations, and hurtled itself into the depths of the approaching Void Engine cloud, emitting a maddened and incoherent distressful cry.\nThe remaining Star Engines each say the same thing.  The story goes that they heard confused Whispers from the Star Engines on the battlefront.  The Whispers were as followed:\n&quot;Luphaion?&quot;\nAnd, then, after a moment, &quot;Epachaneyon?&quot;\nAnd then there was a devastating wave of feedback and disruption, shattering the consciousness of the Star Engines and casting them adrift in the cosmos for eons.\nReawakening\nIn time, the surviving Star Engines began to rewaken, but to a horrible half-existence.  In their comatose state, the Distant Powers, empires which had so wholly relied on the Star Engines to thrive, had been without one half of their equation.  They had been abandoned to their fate, and to this day the Star Engines do not know if any survived or fled.\nWhere there were once entire sporelike clouds fleets of the living supersentient vessels, only six remained after the reawakening.  They were: Aqatarid, Jayanoth, Myacenid, Qia&#39;amon, Shanaoth, and Veya&#39;raj.  At least, those were the only ones capable of hearing or responding to the Whispers.\nWithout their inhabitant colonies to populate them, the Star Engines had no way to perceive the cosmos.  They had no way to navigate it, no way to propel at all.  They were forever adrift in total sensory deprivation, with only one another to speak to.  Who knows how long they floated through space, nothing but cold and dreaming hulks?\nThen, one day, a few million years before humanity was born, one of the Star Engines met the gravitational force of a young golden star, was pulled into orbit, and eventually collided with one of its planets and perished.  This was Jayanoth, and the planet was Earth.\nDiscovering Earth\nIn so many ways everything is small and random when put against a cosmic scale, and the Star Engines, massive and supersentience as they are, are no different.The collision of Jayanoth and Earth was a truly random event, and though it meant the loss of yet another of the Star Engines, something else curious began to occur: Jayanoth&#39;s mighty corpse decomposed on Earth, but its fungal composition found Earth very warm and hospitable.\nSoon the corpse matter of Jayanoth had spread and evolved and coated much of the planet in its fungal tissues.  The mushroom descendants of Jayanoth&#39;s once majestic architecture can be seen almost anywhere on the planet.  Like so much starborn phenomena when it meets Earth, the grand history of this fungus has been subsumed, and become part of everyday life for the inhabitants of the planet.\nThis has had an interesting side-effect: Earth has become perceptible and observable for the remaining Star Engines.  And although they cannot communicate with poor dead Jayanoth anymore, his collision did leave an anchor point in the Fold through which the Star Engines can reach out us, and call out to us, and eventually even pluck us away.\nHumanity\nThe Star Engines have been plucking humans into the Fold for longer than recorded history, but their experiments did not immediately result in Cyclopeans like the modern Infected.\nThe process of Engraving was, all in all, designed entirely in a way which was suitable to the Distant Powers - a race which had symbiotically evolved to be amenable to the Engraving.  The same process, innocent with that symbiotic race, is devastating for a human.\nMost of the first waves of Cyclopeans were disasters or outright casualties - even the successful primeval Cyclopeans were monstrous and unspeakable, and some of those still roam the darker reaches of the Fold, immortal and anguished.\nSubsequent waves of Cyclopeans were generational increments of subtle improvement, each slightly less traumatized, mad and grotesque.  And with each wave, the unsympathetic Star Engines grow slightly more capable and slightly more aware.\nHuman tissues and fungal tissues have an inherently non-symbiotic interaction.  For humans, the Engraving is not an honor - it is a traumatic, consuming Infection of elaborate sentient molds.  The human tissues struggle eternally to reject the fungus they play host to.\nPragmatically, although the process of Engraving has been thoroughly refined over the last ten thousand years, there are still dire consequences.\nFor one, almost all Cyclopeans eventually go mad or incoherent.  The fungal tissues aside, there is an incubating insanity which boils at the edge of the human psyche every time it experiences the Fold and every time it hears the Unearthly Whispers.\nThis madness isn&#39;t confined to the Cyclopeans, either.  Everywhere a Cyclopean goes, the fold is just a tiny bit easier to perceive.  This is a hellish, unsettling experience for any human: glimpses of impossible geometry, spatial incoherence, and monstrous Fold creatures or their obscene tissues.\nHistory is littered with cautionary tales of seeking the Unknowable, and though the Fold and the Star Engines are the natural enemies of the actual Unknowable, to humanity there is no practical distinction.\nThe Edge of the Fold\nAround three thousand years ago, the Star Engines hit something of a tipping point in their efforts to restore their colonies to health through the abduction of the Infected.  They restored enough of their sensory systems to look at the horizons of the Fold again, to watch again for the old enemy of the Distant Powers.\nThe vision that they shared was one they feared but did not fully understand.  At the site of the Breach, the nothingness was bigger than ever - but the tendrils of the Unknowable were not immediately discernible.\nInstead, floating in front of the breach was a massive, grotesque oblong shape, writhing with strange Unknowable iconography and spiraling tendrils of nonexistence.  The shape bulged and contracted, threatening to burst without quite doing it.  The gravity of what they were looking at was clear.\nIt was a massive struggling cloud of Void Engines, Epachaneyon and Luphaion at its center, locked together in an unholy, silent struggle.\nPreparations\nNow the Star Engines have redoubled their effort.  They are Infecting more humans than ever before, in a near panic to shore up their numbers before the Void Engines can cease their struggle and return their attention to the rest of the Fold.\nEvery day, more signs of the tide of this distant struggle and its outcome emerge: increasingly, small pits of Unknowable things open up and spill, bilious with void as though it were amniotic fluid, into the Fold.\nDespite the traumatic experience of the Engraving, it&#39;s very common for Cyclopeans to eventually succumb to the warnings and Whispers of the Star Engines.  For one, the Apparata and the Whispers subtly bend the consciousness of the Cyclopeans to the Star Engines&#39; will - for another, the Unknowable are clearly a threat to existence if left unchecked.\nAnd so the Infected have become a willing hand in the Star Engine&#39;s plans.  In order to save the universe from the Unknowable, first they must Infect the Earth, and then they must Infect the cosmos.\nWhat now?\nYou are now a posthuman, a person constantly experiencing the Fold and perceiving Unearthly Whispers of the Star Engines.  You are one of the Infected, chosen by some device - other Infected, chance, or the Star Engines themselves - to be reborn to a particular Exquisite Design in the service of a long dead empire.\nWhatever your previous life may have been, it has now been subsumed.  In many cases it wouldn&#39;t even have much emotional relevance to you anymore, although in some cases it might.  After seeing what lies beyond the Fold, not to mention the trauma of the Engraving, or the incoherent compulsions of the Whispers, it&#39;s hard to ground yourself in the day to day you used to hold so dear.\nIn plain terms, your consciousness is not now what it was before you were taken.  You are something else in mind and in body, and your responsibilities have changed as well.\nFor one, you no longer sleep, eat, or breathe.  You don&#39;t get sick.  Whatever you need to survive, you seem to generate it involuntarily.  You don&#39;t even seem to bleed anymore, just leak a strange congealed slimy substance.\nYou certainly don&#39;t have recognizable innards anymore, but somehow you pass examinations at airports and hospitals - people stare at you for a moment, mouth agape, then seem to shake off their horror.  This person couldn&#39;t be full of monstrous machinery, could they?\nBut, you are: you feel it constantly.  The pumping, the churning, the grinding of the Apparata working inside of you, their myriad dimensions stretching beyond your body and into the Fold itself, where your new true self perches like a giant parasite upon your worldly human frame.\nSometimes, you leak your new self through the Fold and into the world.  You undergo the Inversion, where your body begins to flip inside out and expose a monstrous but majestic superhumanoid in your place.\nIn the end you&#39;re pretty sure that the best plan is allegiance with the Star Engines.  Although their empire is fallen and everything you&#39;ve become is repulsive and sometimes impossible, what they&#39;re trying to fight back is worse.\nYou&#39;ve seen the Unknowable crawling at the far horizons of the Fold, and you know what they&#39;ll do if they leak into our reality fully: they&#39;ll start to devour it again.  This time, unless you can spread the Infection across untold worlds, starting with your own, they&#39;ve got nothing standing in their way.  They&#39;ll consume everything.\nNow you are a servant to the Distant Powers and their Star Engines.  Now you must wage an ancient galactic war which you cannot hope to win.  Your only hope is to Infect the entire Earth and then start a campaign which will sweep towards other inhabited worlds to Infect them as well.\nThis is a more challenging task than it seems, though: the Star Engines have been fashioning Infected agents on Earth for thousands of years already, and you are only now beginning to gain purchase.  Every time the Infected rise up, an Unknowable Horror breaches the Fold and must be dealt with.  Or if not the Unknowable, then some effort or insight of humanity itself pushes you deeper back.\nTime is running short, and to a large degree the Infected have learned to stage their campaigns in secret, or within the Fold.  Defending Earth and nurturing it towards a certain destination from the shadows has worked the best so far - now humans travel in space, and the infancy of stellar insight is upon the world.\nYou must prime humanity for its journey to the stars and prepare it for its coming Infection.  For the sake of reality.\n"},"cyclopean-culture.html":{"url":"cyclopean-culture.html","title":"Culture","body":"Culture\nExquisite Designs\nYou were made to serve a purpose\nThe Star Engines don&#39;t just cobble together sets of Apparata at random.  Everything serves a purpose for these ancient supersentients, and your capabilities are no different.\nYou were made with an Exquisite Design in mind: ultimately your function is to serve as a living embodiment of the Star Engine&#39;s internal ecosystem.  You were made to be a weapon, or a defense system, or to tend the Engine&#39;s terranean atmosphere, or to steer the Engine as it advances through the stars.\nThere are five major Designs and almost all Cyclopeans are Engraved with Apparata specifically to serve their Design.  Although the fungal origin of an offensive Apparatus could be distinct between two different instances of it in two different Infected, their purpose might be identical, and each instance would most commonly find itself within Cyclopeans Designed for the Swarm.\nEach Swarm carries with it a set of responsibilities, and an overall function within their Star Engine of origin.  Eventually, the Star Engines would see themselves populated with enough Cyclopeans to take over all primary functionality: ideally, before the Unknowable have fully returned from the Fold, so that the remnant vessel Gods of the Distant Powers can have any hope of surviving the second coming of the ancient intergalactic conflict.\nStewards\nStewards intuitively command the atmosphere and temperature of the world around them.  They are the life support systems of the Star Engines, and without these Engraved none others can survive.  Stewards carve habitation out of desolation, and create to growth systems for future biomechanical needs.\nAt their strongest, Stewards were known to be able to terraform entire swaths of hospitable planetoids, creating outposts in the void sustained by a permaculture of spore colonies.   Food, air, drinkable fluids, healing beds: Stewards can spawn it any of it given enough time and practice.\nIn functional terms the Stewards are given to paths of nurturing and nourishment, and their Apparata reflect that.  They are the tenders of comfort and the genesis of life, they are responsible for the perpetuation of the Cyclopean existence.\nThis can turn dark in an instant, however, because although spreading the Cyclopean Infection is a noble act for Cyclopeans and posthumans in general, the sustaining arts of the Stewards are regularly hostile to other types of life.\nIf you were to travel back hundreds of years to see the Empires in their prime, you would see legions of subsumed planets: places where innocent and nascent bio matter had been consumed entirely by the ravenous Infection, all in the name of the war with the Unknowable.  You would see reaches of the Fold with an air thick with Cyclopean-nourshing spores, but thick also with micro organisms which immediately set upon and devoured anything else.\nIn other cases the life was allowed to continue but did so in an Infected way: nervous systems compromised, porous with encepalopathy, minds hollow in the service of new Cyclopean masters and their greater purpose.  Devoured from the inside out.\nThe weight of the posthuman Steward is one of balancing the terraforming, nourishing capabilities of their Apparata with the judicial mind of a former human who generally has no desire to expose their new nature, or harm fellow humans with the Infection.\n\nNicknames: Devourers, Mothers\nApparata: Genesis, Habitation, Infection, Sustenance.\n\nCrucibles\n\nFunction: Batteries and power cores\n\nPioneers\n\nFunction: Navigation and piloting\n\nSensors\n\nFunction: Intelligence and awareness\n\nArmadas\nThe Armada Design is one implemented in such a way that it constructs and spreads ad-hoc species in from the purest fabrics of the Fold.  Armada Cyclopeans are the offensive and defensive modules of the Star Engines, designed to ultimately command entire fleets of mindless stellar beings.\nPhenotypes\nHow you were rebuilt\nThe old Empires of the Distant Powers had a rich technological history, but their machinery was quite different from our own.  The most important difference is that their engines were almost all fungal biomachinery.  Throughout the millennia that the Empires thrived, they cultivated a broad spectrum of production means which were either fungal itself, or spawn by some sort of fungus.\nToday, these fungal agents are regularly bred and reused by the Star Engines in order to create Cyclopean Apparata.  A specific combination of originating Apparata creates a Cyclopean of a certain Phenotype, or in other words, a specific blend of Cyclopean features.\nEach Phenotype is achieved through a combination of Apparata, but is ultimately a distinct semi-species within the Cyclopean hierarchy.  Phenotypes are most commonly distinguished by physical and psychological capabilities, but also they each have a governing Apparata synergy, which presents itself in a few beneficial and a few detrimental ways.\nWithin a certain Phenotype, Cyclopeans are still very distinct from one another - each Cyclopean has their own individual gradiation of progressions within their distinct Phenotype synergies.\nWhich is a fancy way of saying that, for example, while all of the Veya&#39;raj have access to the Veya&#39;rajian Hivemind, not all of them have developed it to the same extent, nor do they all suffer from the same distant qualities which overtake those who have.\nIn a pragmatic way, Phenotypes have formed subcultures within the Cyclopean superculture.  Although they aren&#39;t necessarily predisposed to liking one another, they absolutely have a lot in common with one another and this fosters a great deal of comfort.  It&#39;s traumatic to become a Cyclopean, to say the least, and finding others like yourself means a lot to a newly posthuman.\nAqat&#39;ara, the Luminous\nMyotheid, the Cavernous\nQianaoth, the Still\nSheojoth, the Manifold\nVey&#39;amon, the Hivemind\n"},"cyclopean-appendix.html":{"url":"cyclopean-appendix.html","title":"Appendix","body":"Appendix\nDesign notes\nQuick and dirty\n\nThemes: Abduction, isolation, corruption, insanity, space cultures, Lovecraftian horrors.\nOfficial Name: the Infected\nCreated by: the Engraving\nIntegrity: Coherence\nPower: Warp\nEnergy: Echo\nSupernatural Realm: The Fold\nSupernatural Ability: Apparata\nSupernatural Ability: Cultures\nSupernatural Ability: Inversions\nCategory: Exquisite Design\nLoyalty: Phenotype\n\nConcepts yet to be described\n\nCyclopeans are Power Rangers - except they are also abductees, servants of grotesque and alien consciousnesses.\nStar Engines as demonic escapees from back in the day: Lucifer, etc., who were given time to grow and integrate with the Distant Powers.

These are the massive powers of the Cyclopeans and result in things like grotesque usurpations of other living beings by dream-god flesh, and/or pseudo-insect super-intelligences which start to wage war on the human race both in and out of the Fold.\nThe operating idea here is that Cultures should be pervasive, powerful, horrifying, and very rewarding to sow.\nFold / Space flight and inversion giant battles\n\nNew skill:  Pilot\nIs identical to mass combat, with aggregate stats\nEssentially you equip a spaceship and do damage with it\n\n"},"eternal.html":{"url":"eternal.html","title":"Eternal: The Assembly","body":"Eternal: The Assembly\nGrim reapers given human personification, Doomed to wander the many worlds forever, compelled by the Assembly to the worst points of human and global disaster and bear Witness to the fallen.

Amongst these rituals were the Birth Rites of Black Suns, where a human, sacrificed and drained of blood, would be resurrected as a Lich - an undying thing filled with a Radiant Ichor.  To this day, Liches pursue an agenda from Beyond, obeying an unearthly Compulsion - enacting Astrological magics with dark Grandeur.\n"},"lich-appendix.html":{"url":"lich-appendix.html","title":"Appendix","body":"Appendix\nDesign notes\nLiches take aboard ancient star spirits - pragmatically similar to demons but with a Lovecraftian flavor.  They become otherworldly and strong, and practice dramatic and flexible evil star magics.  Essentially the demon is like a shadow soul imprinted alongside the lich&#39;s human soul, corrupting his body and his intention.  Eventually the lich has to make a choice to either embrace the demon or reject it, each having its own benefits and drawbacks.\nSome neat words\n\nMothlight\n\nQuick and dirty\n\nOfficial Name: the Baleful\nCreated by: the Birth Rite of Black Suns\nIntegrity: Grandeur\nPower: Constellation\nEnergy: Radiance\nSupernatural Advancement: Compulsion\nSupernatural Ability: Glyphs\nSupernatural Ability: Alignments\nCategory: Ichor\nLoyalty: Envoy\n\nWhat are Alignments?\nAlignments are astrological periods where the Lich gains certain auspicious abilities.  An alignment is essentially a God-form, but in a transcendental vs. physical way.  Basically a player can say, at an arbitrary time, that they have a specific Alignment.  It&#39;s powerful but temporary, and discretionary.  In other words the stars don&#39;t actually need to be in alignment for the power to be invoked, it&#39;s just a story function.\nPragmatically, this means that an Alignment form is very powerful but also has a cooldown of sorts, basically an arbitrary timeframe picked in a particular way which will govern that individual power set the best.\nReferences\n\nEarthbound\nLovecraft (Specifically Elder Gods)\n\n"}}}
