<p>You are a Cyclopean.  You were once human, but that was before a thing you came to know as the Star Engine plucked you from Earth.  Without warning, one day while you were alone (only for a few moments), it plucked you up and swept you through the Fold.  You found yourself deposited, alone, into its desolate and alien chambers.</p>
<p>Your abduction was beyond traumatic: it was beyond any nightmare ever dreamt, more grotesque than any horror movie filmed.  You were spat unceremoniously, clammy with fungal slime, into a biomechanical operating theater in the heart of the Star Engine.  And there you were robbed of your humanity, forever.</p>
<h2 id="what-exactly-just-happened">What exactly just happened?</h2>
<p>You were only alone for a few moments, but that&apos;s all it took.  You could have been out for a walk, you could have stepped into the next room, you could have been driving home late.  It doesn&apos;t really matter: everywhere you were, you were unknowingly surrounded by the Fold, and the instruments of the Star Engines reached from afar and took you.</p>
<p>The first thing you experienced was a subtle weight in the air around you, and then things began to go <em>wrong</em>, one by one.  Your radio was overtaken by static, all of the animals dropped silent, or cars began to sputter out and stop around you until everything was still.</p>
<p>A maddening glimpse of the Fold came next: you saw the world <em>yawn wide</em>, expanding to show you its fifth and sixth and seventh extradimensional corners, and you learned that the world you used to know was just a fraction of something greater.  It was just a small slice of the pie of reality.</p>
<p>And then, the next moment, a blinding luminescence with no imaginable origin blanketed everything.  You felt a jerk in the pit of your stomach, as if you were being tugged along by something which had a firm grip on the inside of your gut.</p>
<p>When the light cleared, you were <em>somewhere different</em>, somewhere which didn&apos;t even resemble the unfolded new corners of the place you&apos;d been just moments before.  You were somewhere which looked like a planet, except black and lonely, composed of impossible geometry that challenged and warped your perception with features that simply <em>could not be</em>.</p>
<p>You didn&apos;t know it then, but this was the surface of a Star Engine.  Frost covered everything, but the winds that swept by seared your skin and shredded your clothes with blinding heat.  You were suddenly gasping for air, in agony - as though you stood within a great, vast void.  And, of course, you <em>did</em>.</p>
<p>Then the surface of the Star Engine broke beneath you and a column of light burst from beneath its crust.  The ground pulsed and swelled and came alive, splitting apart to digest you whole, then pass you to your next destination: the operating theater to be pulled open and Engraved.</p>
<h2 id="the-engraving">The Engraving</h2>
<p>You were restrained with the fleshy embrace of cold, wet fungal lobes within the theater, and then you were constricted until you absolutely still.  You could feel the contours and textures of the living machine, and then shortly after you could feel its sharp devices press into your skin and begin to tear you apart.</p>
<p>Every last moment of this process is seared vividly into your memories, every second of your vivisection.  You remember the sensation of being hollowed out, every obscene organic sound.  You remember when the pulsating mass entered you again, filled you up, and begin to knit you back together.</p>
<p>You don&apos;t know why you didn&apos;t die.  Did you die?  Are you dead?  Maybe.</p>
<p>There came a point where the cradle you were in stilled for a second or two, and then it began to churn and swirl again.  You were swept up anew, flushed through some sort of channel, and eventually you were vomited out upon the floor of a large, dimly phosphorescent chamber.</p>
<p>Your discarded organs and an impossible amount of blood surrounded you, covering you like the rags which used to be your clothes.  You shook violently with the cold and the shock of the trauma and you stared.</p>
<p>And there, in that low luminescence, in that lonely new biomechanical cavity: that was when you first began to perceive the Unearthly Whispers.  You began to feel the new organs inside of you whirl and churn and <em>activate</em>.</p>
<p>It told you that you had survived the Engraving.  It welcomed you back, but from where you don&apos;t know.  It said that the time had come to once again face the Unknowable, the <em>things beyond the Fold of reality</em>.  It told you its name - it was unpronounceable, save for its honorific: &apos;of the Star Engines&apos;.  It was a Star Engine.</p>
<p>Whispers of a distant memory infected your mind.  Not your memories, but anothers&apos;.  Was it even your mind anymore?  What had you been infected with?  What had you become?</p>
<h2 id="the-return">The Return</h2>
<p>Now, months later, you have returned to Earth from the Star Engine&apos;s holding, but things aren&apos;t as they once were.  You aren&apos;t anything close to human anymore and madness tends to follow you wherever you go.  Your friends and family may have been the first, but they certainly won&apos;t be the last.</p>
<p>When you hear stories of alien abduction, your attention perks.  Usually the culprits of these stories are attention seekers, but sometimes <em>there&apos;s something to it</em>.  Something news of phenomena or curious happenstance are genuinely the touch of the extraterrestrial.  Sometimes it precipitates another who is like you - someone who has been Engraved.  A Cyclopean, one of the Infected.</p>
<p>You know that there are thousands more just like you, others who&apos;ve been put under an organic imperative to serve the Star Engines.  Like you they are disfigured: though most of you can pass for human fully clothed, you certainly couldn&apos;t pass careful scrutiny.</p>
<p>For one, your chest is a lattice of grotesque scars, implementing a curious geometry into your flesh.  It&apos;s like a fractal demonstration of a dozen autopsies, and it&apos;s only the first of the tangible indications of your post-humanity.  There is so much more evidence of what you are than your scars, though.</p>
<p>There are the Apparata.  They are biomechanical machinery, distant micro-relatives of the massive Star Engine you were born in.  Inside you they unceasingly work - they keep you alive, let you cross into the Fold without dying, and they sometimes <em>turn you inside out, Inverting you into a completely new being</em>.</p>
<p>There are the Unearthly Whispers.  This is the living voice of the fungal symbiote you&apos;ve been coupled with.  It is an actual living part of you now and it has a will which neighbors your own.  It speaks to you, it overlays the fabric of other realities on your vision, it warns you of danger and tells you secrets, and you&apos;re pretty sure that it <em>slowly drives the people around you mad</em>.</p>
<p>And there is the Lidless Eye.</p>
<h3 id="the-lidless-eye">The Lidless Eye</h3>
<p>It&apos;s the only thing which you and all of the other Infected share in common: a single palm-sized Lidless Eye.  It peers around of its own free will, a horrific veined, too-detailed orb which seems almost completely impervious to harm.  Its black pupil expands and contracts in maddening syncopation with any stimuli.</p>
<p>You can peer through it, and in uncovering it you amplify the strength of your Unearthly Whispers while at the same time you expose the nature of your posthumanity.  Maybe you&apos;re hesitant to, though - because <em>what else could be looking through it</em>?  It isn&apos;t always you that controls where it peers.</p>
<p>There are many locations where the Eye emerges, but there are five places which are the most common:</p>
<ul>
<li>The forehead</li>
<li>The throat</li>
<li>The chest</li>
<li>The upper back</li>
<li>The abdomen</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, some have it upon their shoulders, some within their palms, and some have more than one.  But most of the Infected have a single eye, centrally aligned with the spinal column.</p>
<p>In all cases the Lidless Eye is obscene, hideous and alien: it is an unholy thing which lays bare the lie of reality for any who see it, and emits pure madness in concentrated, erratic waves.</p>
<h2 id="the-star-engines">The Star Engines</h2>
<p>The Star Engines are a powerful fleet of supersentient biomechanical planets.  Each one is vast even in our reality, but their form doesn&apos;t stop there: they expand in every direction and dimension, each one stretching deep within the reaches of the Fold.</p>
<p>The Star Engines were originally instrumented and grown by the Distant Powers, an unimaginably old alien empire.  Over hundreds of thousands of years they were deliberately evolved and augmented, until they had become the primary home and means of conquest for the empire.</p>
<h3 id="symbiosis-and-evolution">Symbiosis and Evolution</h3>
<p>Over this long stretch of time a symbiosis began to emerge between the Star Engines and the Distant Powers.  The Star Engines became a massive host and advisory system, guarding and furthering the Powers.  In exchange, the Powers would provide supplicants to the Star Engines: members of the empire which would willingly submit for Engraving, and become living portions of the Star Engine&apos;s complex internal systems.</p>
<p>Indeed, the Distant Powers had even begun to evolve over time so that supplication into the machinery of the Star Engines was something that their body and mind could handle painlessly.  To become a supplicant was a great honor and many strove for it, not in the least because the Engraving bestowed transcendent ability on any who partook.</p>
<p>Distinct purposes were assigned to each supplicant dependent on their ability, and according to their will.  These were the Exquisite Designs: singular purposes which resulted from a particular combination of Apparata.</p>
<p>Every design was specifically suited to integration into the Star Engine in a different way.  Entire colonies of a particular design would inhabit the Engine in regions bent to their particular purpose - defensive systems, navigation systems, and so on.  These colonies became the functional empowerment of their particular Star Engine, a synthesis between fungal biomachinery and living will.</p>
<p>Over time, each Star Engine began to breed its own phenotype of Apparata, as the colonies and their descendants evolved more and more in the internal ecosystem of their particular home Engine.  Cultures of colonies became diverse across the Engines but homogenous within each particular Star Engine; the Distant Powers progressed into many subspecies as they spread inexorably between galaxies and into the Fold.</p>
<h3 id="the-consequence-of-exploration">The Consequence of Exploration</h3>
<p>Each Star Engine used the technology of the Fold to whisper to one another, and every Engraved supplicant perceived these Whispers.  And so, like drifting clouds of fungal spores, the Star Engines numbering in the thousands floated through the stars.  Cloud fleets of the supersentient ecosystems swept across the universe, exploring every stretch of the vastness and every indescribable corner of the Fold.</p>
<p>Then there came a day when a distant cloud of Star Engines emitted in unison one sudden distress cry and were cut off: vanished into the horizons of the Fold.  It had all happened in an eyeblink, with no warning or time for reaction.  First the exploratory cloud was there in the far frontiers, and then they simply <em>weren&apos;t</em>.</p>
<p>For a time the other Star Engines in the surviving clouds were quiet with shock, and then they converged with curiosity.  Limbs of the drifting empire began to shift course and navigate towards the site of the lost cloud.  The hope was to rescue or save the lost Engines, but upon arriving, the Distant Powers found something far more horrible than they had expected.</p>
<h3 id="the-breach-and-the-unknowable">The Breach and the Unknowable</h3>
<p>A section of the Fold had collapsed, and at its core there was nothing, <em>nothing at all</em>.  At least, at first.  But then, from the depths of the void, tendrils began to snake forth, grasping at the edges of the Fold and pulsating along the seam of existence.  The Unknowable had found their way into the Fold, and through it, reality.</p>
<p>The Unknowable, as best as the Distant Powers were ever able to learn, were creatures of an inside-out relationship with <em>being</em>.  Hypothesis of all sorts would be offered by the suddenly threatened empire, but nothing was ever to be proven.</p>
<p>Unbound by physical law or even the transcendental geometry of the Fold, the Unknowable were something else entirely.  Something wholly beyond the horizons of reason.  But more importantly than all of that, the Unknowable were first and foremost <em>hungry</em>, and they sprawled forth from the original breach at a striking pace, quickly consuming the first clouds of Star Engines in hours in a pulsing, barely perceptible bulge of Unknowable void tissues.</p>
<p>The moment of the Breach precipitated a coming war between the Distant Powers and the Unknowable.  It was a struggle for dominance as much as survival, and it became a primeval thing, spanning generations of the empire.  It was a war which would last tens of thousands of years, and eventually consume the entire empire and almost all of its glorious invention and history.</p>
<h3 id="the-void-engines">The Void Engines</h3>
<p>Most wars are told in a series of sagas, long struggles interleaved with pivotal moments of change in the turmoil.  One of those moments came for the ten thousand year war with the emergence of the Void Engines.  It came from the Breach, the place in the far horizons where the Unknowable had originally discovered the Fold.</p>
<p>A chilling signal, an obscene perversion of the Whispers, began to emit from  beyond the Breach.  Soon after the Obscene Whispers came, so too did the Void Engines.</p>
<p>Wrought upon the carapace and bio-matter of the originally consumed Star Engines, the Void Engines were violated, decrepit hulks formed of the gestalt of imperial dead matter and Unknowable void tissues.  The union of the Star Engines and the monsters beyond reality.</p>
<h3 id="the-turning-point">The Turning Point</h3>
<p>Bleak mirrors of the Distant Powers, the unsettling return of the lost engines in this perverse capacity could have been the final pivotal moment of the conflict, except for a grave mistake on the part of the Unknowable.  What was first a deeply unsettling experience - the pollution of the communications network all of the Star Engines and Distant Powers relied upon - became an exploitable point of knowledge for the remnants of the Empire.</p>
<p>What actually ended the war isn&apos;t widely known, as its effects were devastating beyond all expectation.  The Star Engines which remain to this day only survived because they were far enough from the event horizon of what is known as the Sealing.</p>
<p>This is what is known: two names.  Epachaneyon and Luphaion.</p>
<h3 id="epachaneyon-and-luphaion">Epachaneyon and Luphaion</h3>
<p>Epachaneyon was one of the most massive of the Star Engines, and also one of the foremost explorer cultures.  Epachaneyon had been one of the Engines which had vanished in the Breach, and it had been one of the first Void Engines who had returned, blasphemed by the Unknowable.</p>
<p>Luphaion had been the first Star Engine to attempt communication with the Void Engines.  It had emerged from one of the closest battle formations, and hurtled itself into the depths of the approaching Void Engine cloud, emitting a maddened and incoherent distressful cry.</p>
<p>The remaining Star Engines each say the same thing.  The story goes that they heard confused Whispers from the Star Engines on the battlefront.  The Whispers were as followed:</p>
<p>&quot;Luphaion?&quot;</p>
<p>And, then, after a moment, &quot;Epachaneyon?&quot;</p>
<p>And then there was a devastating wave of feedback and disruption, shattering the consciousness of the Star Engines and casting them adrift in the cosmos for eons.</p>
<h3 id="reawakening">Reawakening</h3>
<p>In time, the surviving Star Engines began to rewaken, but to a horrible half-existence.  In their comatose state, the Distant Powers, empires which had so wholly relied on the Star Engines to thrive, had been without one half of their equation.  They had been abandoned to their fate, and to this day the Star Engines do not know if any survived or fled.</p>
<p>Where there were once entire sporelike clouds fleets of the living supersentient vessels, only six remained after the reawakening.  They were: Aqatarid, Jayanoth, Myacenid, Qia&apos;amon, Shanaoth, and Veya&apos;raj.  At least, those were the only ones capable of hearing or responding to the Whispers.</p>
<p>Without their inhabitant colonies to populate them, the Star Engines had no way to perceive the cosmos.  They had no way to navigate it, no way to propel at all.  They were forever adrift in total sensory deprivation, with only one another to speak to.  Who knows how long they floated through space, nothing but cold and dreaming hulks?</p>
<p>Then, one day, a few million years before humanity was born, one of the Star Engines met the gravitational force of a young golden star, was pulled into orbit, and eventually collided with one of its planets and perished.  This was Jayanoth, and the planet was Earth.</p>
<h3 id="discovering-earth">Discovering Earth</h3>
<p>In so many ways everything is small and random when put against a cosmic scale, and the Star Engines, massive and supersentience as they are, are no different.<br>The collision of Jayanoth and Earth was a truly random event, and though it meant the loss of yet another of the Star Engines, something else curious began to occur: Jayanoth&apos;s mighty corpse decomposed on Earth, but its fungal composition found Earth very warm and hospitable.</p>
<p>Soon the corpse matter of Jayanoth had spread and evolved and coated much of the planet in its fungal tissues.  The mushroom descendants of Jayanoth&apos;s once majestic architecture can be seen almost anywhere on the planet.  Like so much starborn phenomena when it meets Earth, the grand history of this fungus has been subsumed, and become part of everyday life for the inhabitants of the planet.</p>
<p>This has had an interesting side-effect: Earth has become perceptible and observable for the remaining Star Engines.  And although they cannot communicate with poor dead Jayanoth anymore, his collision did leave an anchor point in the Fold through which the Star Engines can reach out us, and call out to us, and eventually even pluck us away.</p>
<h3 id="humanity">Humanity</h3>
<p>The Star Engines have been plucking humans into the Fold for longer than recorded history, but their experiments did not immediately result in Cyclopeans like the modern Infected.</p>
<p>The process of Engraving was, all in all, designed entirely in a way which was suitable to the Distant Powers - a race which had symbiotically evolved to be amenable to the Engraving.  The same process, innocent with that symbiotic race, is devastating for a human.</p>
<p>Most of the first waves of Cyclopeans were disasters or outright casualties - even the successful primeval Cyclopeans were monstrous and unspeakable, and some of those still roam the darker reaches of the Fold, immortal and anguished.</p>
<p>Subsequent waves of Cyclopeans were generational increments of subtle improvement, each slightly less traumatized, mad and grotesque.  And with each wave, the unsympathetic Star Engines grow slightly more capable and slightly more aware.</p>
<p>Human tissues and fungal tissues have an inherently non-symbiotic interaction.  For humans, the Engraving is not an honor - it is a traumatic, consuming Infection of elaborate sentient molds.  The human tissues struggle eternally to reject the fungus they play host to.</p>
<p>Pragmatically, although the process of Engraving has been thoroughly refined over the last ten thousand years, there are still dire consequences.</p>
<p>For one, almost all Cyclopeans eventually go mad or incoherent.  The fungal tissues aside, there is an incubating insanity which boils at the edge of the human psyche every time it experiences the Fold and every time it hears the Unearthly Whispers.</p>
<p>This madness isn&apos;t confined to the Cyclopeans, either.  Everywhere a Cyclopean goes, the fold is just a tiny bit easier to perceive.  This is a hellish, unsettling experience for any human: glimpses of impossible geometry, spatial incoherence, and monstrous Fold creatures or their obscene tissues.</p>
<p>History is littered with cautionary tales of seeking the Unknowable, and though the Fold and the Star Engines are the natural enemies of the <em>actual</em> Unknowable, to humanity there is no practical distinction.</p>
<h3 id="the-edge-of-the-fold">The Edge of the Fold</h3>
<p>Around three thousand years ago, the Star Engines hit something of a tipping point in their efforts to restore their colonies to health through the abduction of the Infected.  They restored enough of their sensory systems to look at the horizons of the Fold again, to watch again for the old enemy of the Distant Powers.</p>
<p>The vision that they shared was one they feared but did not fully understand.  At the site of the Breach, the nothingness was bigger than ever - but the tendrils of the Unknowable were not immediately discernible.</p>
<p>Instead, floating in front of the breach was a massive, grotesque oblong shape, writhing with strange Unknowable iconography and spiraling tendrils of nonexistence.  The shape bulged and contracted, threatening to burst without quite doing it.  The gravity of what they were looking at was clear.</p>
<p>It was a massive struggling cloud of Void Engines, Epachaneyon and Luphaion at its center, locked together in an unholy, silent struggle.</p>
<h3 id="preparations">Preparations</h3>
<p>Now the Star Engines have redoubled their effort.  They are Infecting more humans than ever before, in a near panic to shore up their numbers before the Void Engines can cease their struggle and return their attention to the rest of the Fold.</p>
<p>Every day, more signs of the tide of this distant struggle and its outcome emerge: increasingly, small pits of Unknowable things open up and spill, bilious with void as though it were amniotic fluid, into the Fold.</p>
<p>Despite the traumatic experience of the Engraving, it&apos;s very common for Cyclopeans to eventually succumb to the warnings and Whispers of the Star Engines.  For one, the Apparata and the Whispers subtly bend the consciousness of the Cyclopeans to the Star Engines&apos; will - for another, the Unknowable are clearly a threat to existence if left unchecked.</p>
<p>And so the Infected have become a willing hand in the Star Engine&apos;s plans.  In order to save the universe from the Unknowable, first they must Infect the Earth, and then they must Infect the cosmos.</p>
<h2 id="what-now">What now?</h2>
<p>You are now a posthuman, a person constantly experiencing the Fold and perceiving Unearthly Whispers of the Star Engines.  You are one of the Infected, chosen by some device - other Infected, chance, or the Star Engines themselves - to be reborn to a particular Exquisite Design in the service of a long dead empire.</p>
<p>Whatever your previous life may have been, it has now been subsumed.  In many cases it wouldn&apos;t even have much emotional relevance to you anymore, although in some cases it might.  After seeing what lies beyond the Fold, not to mention the trauma of the Engraving, or the incoherent compulsions of the Whispers, it&apos;s hard to ground yourself in the day to day you used to hold so dear.</p>
<p>In plain terms, your consciousness is not now what it was before you were taken.  You are <em>something else</em> in mind and in body, and your responsibilities have changed as well.</p>
<p>For one, you no longer sleep, eat, or breathe.  You don&apos;t get sick.  Whatever you need to survive, you seem to generate it involuntarily.  You don&apos;t even seem to bleed anymore, just leak a strange congealed slimy substance.</p>
<p>You certainly don&apos;t have recognizable innards anymore, but somehow you pass examinations at airports and hospitals - people stare at you for a moment, mouth agape, then seem to shake off their horror.  This person couldn&apos;t be full of monstrous machinery, could they?</p>
<p>But, you are: you feel it constantly.  The pumping, the churning, the grinding of the Apparata working inside of you, their myriad dimensions stretching beyond your body and into the Fold itself, where your new true self perches like a giant parasite upon your worldly human frame.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you leak your new self through the Fold and into the world.  You undergo the Inversion, where your body begins to flip inside out and expose a monstrous but majestic superhumanoid in your place.</p>
<p>In the end you&apos;re pretty sure that the best plan is allegiance with the Star Engines.  Although their empire is fallen and everything you&apos;ve become is repulsive and sometimes <em>impossible</em>, what they&apos;re trying to fight back is worse.</p>
<p>You&apos;ve seen the Unknowable crawling at the far horizons of the Fold, and you know what they&apos;ll do if they leak into our reality fully: they&apos;ll start to devour it again.  This time, unless you can spread the Infection across untold worlds, starting with your own, they&apos;ve got nothing standing in their way.  They&apos;ll consume everything.</p>
<p>Now you are a servant to the Distant Powers and their Star Engines.  Now you must wage an ancient galactic war which you cannot hope to win.  Your only hope is to Infect the entire Earth and then start a campaign which will sweep towards other inhabited worlds to Infect them as well.</p>
<p>This is a more challenging task than it seems, though: the Star Engines have been fashioning Infected agents on Earth for thousands of years already, and you are only now beginning to gain purchase.  Every time the Infected rise up, an Unknowable Horror breaches the Fold and must be dealt with.  Or if not the Unknowable, then some effort or insight of humanity itself pushes you deeper back.</p>
<p>Time is running short, and to a large degree the Infected have learned to stage their campaigns in secret, or within the Fold.  Defending Earth and nurturing it towards a certain destination from the shadows has worked the best so far - now humans travel in space, and the infancy of stellar insight is upon the world.</p>
<p>You must prime humanity for its journey to the stars and prepare it for its coming Infection.  For the sake of reality.</p>
