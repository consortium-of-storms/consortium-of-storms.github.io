## What now?

You are now a posthuman, a person constantly experiencing the Fold and perceiving Unearthly Whispers of the Star Engines.  You are one of the Infected, chosen by some device - other Infected, chance, or the Star Engines themselves - to be reborn to a particular Exquisite Design in the service of a long dead empire.

Whatever your previous life may have been, it has now been subsumed.  In many cases it wouldn't even have much emotional relevance to you anymore, although in some cases it might.  After seeing what lies beyond the Fold, not to mention the trauma of the Engraving, or the incoherent compulsions of the Whispers, it's hard to ground yourself in the day to day you used to hold so dear.

In plain terms, your consciousness is not now what it was before you were taken.  You are _something else_ in mind and in body, and your responsibilities have changed as well.

For one, you no longer sleep, eat, or breathe.  You don't get sick.  Whatever you need to survive, you seem to generate it involuntarily.  You don't even seem to bleed anymore, just leak a strange congealed slimy substance.

You certainly don't have recognizable innards anymore, but somehow you pass examinations at airports and hospitals - people stare at you for a moment, mouth agape, then seem to shake off their horror.  This person couldn't be full of monstrous machinery, could they?

But, you are: you feel it constantly.  The pumping, the churning, the grinding of the Apparata working inside of you, their myriad dimensions stretching beyond your body and into the Fold itself, where your new true self perches like a giant parasite upon your worldly human frame.

Sometimes, you leak your new self through the Fold and into the world.  You undergo the Inversion, where your body begins to flip inside out and expose a monstrous but majestic superhumanoid in your place.

In the end you're pretty sure that the best plan is allegiance with the Star Engines.  Although their empire is fallen and everything you've become is repulsive and sometimes _impossible_, what they're trying to fight back is worse.

You've seen the Unknowable crawling at the far horizons of the Fold, and you know what they'll do if they leak into our reality fully: they'll start to devour it again.  This time, unless you can spread the Infection across untold worlds, starting with your own, they've got nothing standing in their way.  They'll consume everything.

Now you are a servant to the Distant Powers and their Star Engines.  Now you must wage an ancient galactic war which you cannot hope to win.  Your only hope is to Infect the entire Earth and then start a campaign which will sweep towards other inhabited worlds to Infect them as well.

This is a more challenging task than it seems, though: the Star Engines have been fashioning Infected agents on Earth for thousands of years already, and you are only now beginning to gain purchase.  Every time the Infected rise up, an Unknowable Horror breaches the Fold and must be dealt with.  Or if not the Unknowable, then some effort or insight of humanity itself pushes you deeper back.

Time is running short, and to a large degree the Infected have learned to stage their campaigns in secret, or within the Fold.  Defending Earth and nurturing it towards a certain destination from the shadows has worked the best so far - now humans travel in space, and the infancy of stellar insight is upon the world.

You must prime humanity for its journey to the stars and prepare it for its coming Infection.  For the sake of reality.
