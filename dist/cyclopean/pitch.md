## As a Cyclopean, you will

* Cradle within your human husk a grotesque array of alien **Apparata**.
* Perceive the fabric of **Unearthly Whispers** which overlay reality.
* Assume your **Inversion**, a warped, monstrous alien self.
* Serve and occupy the Star Engines: vast supersentient primeval husks of ancient civilization, drifting hollow through the void of space.
* Struggle against the approaching monstrous agents of the *Unknowable*.
* Begin the process of fashioning the Earth anew, infecting it with the dread machinery of the Distant Powers.
