### The Lidless Eye

It's the only thing which you and all of the other Infected share in common: a single palm-sized Lidless Eye.  It peers around of its own free will, a horrific veined, too-detailed orb which seems almost completely impervious to harm.  Its black pupil expands and contracts in maddening syncopation with any stimuli.

You can peer through it, and in uncovering it you amplify the strength of your Unearthly Whispers while at the same time you expose the nature of your posthumanity.  Maybe you're hesitant to, though - because _what else could be looking through it_?  It isn't always you that controls where it peers.

There are many locations where the Eye emerges, but there are five places which are the most common:

* The forehead
* The throat
* The chest
* The upper back
* The abdomen

Still, some have it upon their shoulders, some within their palms, and some have more than one.  But most of the Infected have a single eye, centrally aligned with the spinal column.

In all cases the Lidless Eye is obscene, hideous and alien: it is an unholy thing which lays bare the lie of reality for any who see it, and emits pure madness in concentrated, erratic waves.
