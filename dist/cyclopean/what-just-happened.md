## What exactly just happened?

You were only alone for a few moments, but that's all it took.  You could have been out for a walk, you could have stepped into the next room, you could have been driving home late.  It doesn't really matter: everywhere you were, you were unknowingly surrounded by the Fold, and the instruments of the Star Engines reached from afar and took you.

The first thing you experienced was a subtle weight in the air around you, and then things began to go _wrong_, one by one.  Your radio was overtaken by static, all of the animals dropped silent, or cars began to sputter out and stop around you until everything was still.

A maddening glimpse of the Fold came next: you saw the world _yawn wide_, expanding to show you its fifth and sixth and seventh extradimensional corners, and you learned that the world you used to know was just a fraction of something greater.  It was just a small slice of the pie of reality.

And then, the next moment, a blinding luminescence with no imaginable origin blanketed everything.  You felt a jerk in the pit of your stomach, as if you were being tugged along by something which had a firm grip on the inside of your gut.

When the light cleared, you were _somewhere different_, somewhere which didn't even resemble the unfolded new corners of the place you'd been just moments before.  You were somewhere which looked like a planet, except black and lonely, composed of impossible geometry that challenged and warped your perception with features that simply _could not be_.

You didn't know it then, but this was the surface of a Star Engine.  Frost covered everything, but the winds that swept by seared your skin and shredded your clothes with blinding heat.  You were suddenly gasping for air, in agony - as though you stood within a great, vast void.  And, of course, you _did_.

Then the surface of the Star Engine broke beneath you and a column of light burst from beneath its crust.  The ground pulsed and swelled and came alive, splitting apart to digest you whole, then pass you to your next destination: the operating theater to be pulled open and Engraved.
