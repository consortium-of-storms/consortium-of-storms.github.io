## Design notes

### Quick and dirty

* Themes: Abduction, isolation, corruption, insanity, space cultures, Lovecraftian horrors.
* Official Name: the Infected
* Created by: the Engraving
* Integrity: Coherence
* Power: Warp
* Energy: Echo
* Supernatural Realm: The Fold
* Supernatural Ability: Apparata
* Supernatural Ability: Cultures
* Supernatural Ability: Inversions
* Category: Exquisite Design
* Loyalty: Phenotype

### Concepts yet to be described

* Cyclopeans are Power Rangers - except they are also abductees, servants of grotesque and alien consciousnesses.
* Star Engines as demonic escapees from back in the day: Lucifer, etc., who were given time to grow and integrate with the Distant Powers.  In other words, a potential history that depicts Star Engines as superdemons.
* Most Cyclopean conflicts occur within the Fold, a split of space time where the Star Engines and the Unknowable dwell.
* Unknowable taint is referred to as Unearthly Influence.
* Infections and Unearthly Influence in the Fold permeate into the real world in the form of atrocity and unrest.
* Cyclopeans gradually warp reality until it becomes slowly Infected, increasing the chances that the Fold will grow in power and influence over the Cyclopeans' eminent surroundings.
* Cyclopeans inside the Fold are always Inverted.
* Cyclopeans can combine into Mass Inversions: Giant singular entities made of a gestalt of many beings.
* The God-Machine and angels have it out for Cyclopeans.  It would make the forces of the God-Machine very happy to nip the Cyclopean problem in the bud.
* Demons have no idea what to think of Cyclopeans, but recognize them as somehow related.  Some demons believe that the Cyclopean Fold could potentially even be the _actual Hell_.
* Design-wise, Cyclopeans should have a lot in common with Demons and Prometheans.  Their struggles are tremendous but inobvious to humans in general, and they should provoke some sort of subtle sensation of anxiety and disgust around humans given enough time.

### Cool words

Cyclopeans sit at a junction of Victorian era / pulp era tech and fungal space horror.  Most words in their mythos should evolve around that.

* Slime mold
* Mold
* Spoor
* Creep
* Spawn
* Spore
* Any mushroomy name, really

## Exquisite Design Description Guidelines

Each Exquisite Design section should contain the following:

* What they are supposed to do
* What they pragmatically do
* What they used to do
* How things went right
* How things went wrong
* The most powerful / cool things they can do
* What the Engraving experience is like
* How they look as modern Cyclopeans
* Several stories of potential Cyclopeans
* Prevalent Implementations (sub-designs)
* Their relationship with the Fold
* Why specific humans are chosen
* Their Engraved Apparatus
* Their Incoherency
* Their Unearthly Whispers
* Nicknames (at least one good and one derogatory)

## Change names:

* Chamberlains become Stewards
* Supersentients become Sensors
* Superluminals become Pioneers
* Swarms become Armadas
* Originators become Crucibles

Alternately, words or titles based on those.  Instead of "Design", even, these could be "Titles".  And the Design could be something related to it.

## System changes

* Whispers must be tied in to Supersentience
* Cyclopeans gradually dissolve into the fold as they gain in Warp and lose Coherence
* Echo?  Why?  How is that fungal at all?

### Powerframes

Cultures are interesting and bring to mind a specific ultra-powerful sort of idea: with time and maintenance, a Cyclopean should be able to spread a culture which will gradually build strength and grant him abilities so long as he spends a certain amount of time around that culture.  These are the massive powers of the Cyclopeans and result in things like grotesque usurpations of other living beings by dream-god flesh, and/or pseudo-insect super-intelligences which start to wage war on the human race both in and out of the Fold.

The operating idea here is that Cultures should be pervasive, powerful, horrifying, and very rewarding to sow.

## Fold / Space flight and inversion giant battles

* New skill:  Pilot
* Is identical to mass combat, with aggregate stats
* Essentially you equip a spaceship and do damage with it
