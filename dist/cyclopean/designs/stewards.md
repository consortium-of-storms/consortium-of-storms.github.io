### Stewards

Stewards intuitively command the atmosphere and temperature of the world around them.  They are the life support systems of the Star Engines, and without these Engraved none others can survive.  Stewards carve habitation out of desolation, and create to growth systems for future biomechanical needs.

At their strongest, Stewards were known to be able to terraform entire swaths of hospitable planetoids, creating outposts in the void sustained by a permaculture of spore colonies.   Food, air, drinkable fluids, healing beds: Stewards can spawn it any of it given enough time and practice.

In functional terms the Stewards are given to paths of nurturing and nourishment, and their Apparata reflect that.  They are the tenders of comfort and the genesis of life, they are responsible for the perpetuation of the Cyclopean existence.

This can turn dark in an instant, however, because although spreading the Cyclopean Infection is a noble act _for Cyclopeans_ and posthumans in general, the sustaining arts of the Stewards are regularly hostile to other types of life.

If you were to travel back hundreds of years to see the Empires in their prime, you would see legions of subsumed planets: places where innocent and nascent bio matter had been consumed entirely by the ravenous Infection, all in the name of the war with the Unknowable.  You would see reaches of the Fold with an air thick with Cyclopean-nourshing spores, but thick also with micro organisms which immediately set upon and devoured anything else.

In other cases the life was allowed to continue but did so in an Infected way: nervous systems compromised, porous with encepalopathy, minds hollow in the service of new Cyclopean masters and their greater purpose.  Devoured from the inside out.

The weight of the posthuman Steward is one of balancing the terraforming, nourishing capabilities of their Apparata with the judicial mind of a former human who generally has no desire to expose their new nature, or harm fellow humans with the Infection.
