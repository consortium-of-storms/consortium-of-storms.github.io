### The Turning Point

Bleak mirrors of the Distant Powers, the unsettling return of the lost engines in this perverse capacity could have been the final pivotal moment of the conflict, except for a grave mistake on the part of the Unknowable.  What was first a deeply unsettling experience - the pollution of the communications network all of the Star Engines and Distant Powers relied upon - became an exploitable point of knowledge for the remnants of the Empire.

What actually ended the war isn't widely known, as its effects were devastating beyond all expectation.  The Star Engines which remain to this day only survived because they were far enough from the event horizon of what is known as the Sealing.

This is what is known: two names.  Epachaneyon and Luphaion.
