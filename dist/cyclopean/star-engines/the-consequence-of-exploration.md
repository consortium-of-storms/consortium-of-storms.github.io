### The Consequence of Exploration

Each Star Engine used the technology of the Fold to whisper to one another, and every Engraved supplicant perceived these Whispers.  And so, like drifting clouds of fungal spores, the Star Engines numbering in the thousands floated through the stars.  Cloud fleets of the supersentient ecosystems swept across the universe, exploring every stretch of the vastness and every indescribable corner of the Fold.

Then there came a day when a distant cloud of Star Engines emitted in unison one sudden distress cry and were cut off: vanished into the horizons of the Fold.  It had all happened in an eyeblink, with no warning or time for reaction.  First the exploratory cloud was there in the far frontiers, and then they simply _weren't_.

For a time the other Star Engines in the surviving clouds were quiet with shock, and then they converged with curiosity.  Limbs of the drifting empire began to shift course and navigate towards the site of the lost cloud.  The hope was to rescue or save the lost Engines, but upon arriving, the Distant Powers found something far more horrible than they had expected.
