### The Edge of the Fold

Around three thousand years ago, the Star Engines hit something of a tipping point in their efforts to restore their colonies to health through the abduction of the Infected.  They restored enough of their sensory systems to look at the horizons of the Fold again, to watch again for the old enemy of the Distant Powers.

The vision that they shared was one they feared but did not fully understand.  At the site of the Breach, the nothingness was bigger than ever - but the tendrils of the Unknowable were not immediately discernible.

Instead, floating in front of the breach was a massive, grotesque oblong shape, writhing with strange Unknowable iconography and spiraling tendrils of nonexistence.  The shape bulged and contracted, threatening to burst without quite doing it.  The gravity of what they were looking at was clear.

It was a massive struggling cloud of Void Engines, Epachaneyon and Luphaion at its center, locked together in an unholy, silent struggle.
