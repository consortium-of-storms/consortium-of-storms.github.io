### The Void Engines

Most wars are told in a series of sagas, long struggles interleaved with pivotal moments of change in the turmoil.  One of those moments came for the ten thousand year war with the emergence of the Void Engines.  It came from the Breach, the place in the far horizons where the Unknowable had originally discovered the Fold.

A chilling signal, an obscene perversion of the Whispers, began to emit from  beyond the Breach.  Soon after the Obscene Whispers came, so too did the Void Engines.

Wrought upon the carapace and bio-matter of the originally consumed Star Engines, the Void Engines were violated, decrepit hulks formed of the gestalt of imperial dead matter and Unknowable void tissues.  The union of the Star Engines and the monsters beyond reality.
