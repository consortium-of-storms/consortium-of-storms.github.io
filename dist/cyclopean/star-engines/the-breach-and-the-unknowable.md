### The Breach and the Unknowable

A section of the Fold had collapsed, and at its core there was nothing, _nothing at all_.  At least, at first.  But then, from the depths of the void, tendrils began to snake forth, grasping at the edges of the Fold and pulsating along the seam of existence.  The Unknowable had found their way into the Fold, and through it, reality.

The Unknowable, as best as the Distant Powers were ever able to learn, were creatures of an inside-out relationship with _being_.  Hypothesis of all sorts would be offered by the suddenly threatened empire, but nothing was ever to be proven.

Unbound by physical law or even the transcendental geometry of the Fold, the Unknowable were something else entirely.  Something wholly beyond the horizons of reason.  But more importantly than all of that, the Unknowable were first and foremost _hungry_, and they sprawled forth from the original breach at a striking pace, quickly consuming the first clouds of Star Engines in hours in a pulsing, barely perceptible bulge of Unknowable void tissues.

The moment of the Breach precipitated a coming war between the Distant Powers and the Unknowable.  It was a struggle for dominance as much as survival, and it became a primeval thing, spanning generations of the empire.  It was a war which would last tens of thousands of years, and eventually consume the entire empire and almost all of its glorious invention and history.
