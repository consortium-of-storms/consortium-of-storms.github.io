### Preparations

Now the Star Engines have redoubled their effort.  They are Infecting more humans than ever before, in a near panic to shore up their numbers before the Void Engines can cease their struggle and return their attention to the rest of the Fold.

Every day, more signs of the tide of this distant struggle and its outcome emerge: increasingly, small pits of Unknowable things open up and spill, bilious with void as though it were amniotic fluid, into the Fold.

Despite the traumatic experience of the Engraving, it's very common for Cyclopeans to eventually succumb to the warnings and Whispers of the Star Engines.  For one, the Apparata and the Whispers subtly bend the consciousness of the Cyclopeans to the Star Engines' will - for another, the Unknowable are clearly a threat to existence if left unchecked.

And so the Infected have become a willing hand in the Star Engine's plans.  In order to save the universe from the Unknowable, first they must Infect the Earth, and then they must Infect the cosmos.
