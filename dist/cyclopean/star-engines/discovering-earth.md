### Discovering Earth

In so many ways everything is small and random when put against a cosmic scale, and the Star Engines, massive and supersentience as they are, are no different.  
The collision of Jayanoth and Earth was a truly random event, and though it meant the loss of yet another of the Star Engines, something else curious began to occur: Jayanoth's mighty corpse decomposed on Earth, but its fungal composition found Earth very warm and hospitable.

Soon the corpse matter of Jayanoth had spread and evolved and coated much of the planet in its fungal tissues.  The mushroom descendants of Jayanoth's once majestic architecture can be seen almost anywhere on the planet.  Like so much starborn phenomena when it meets Earth, the grand history of this fungus has been subsumed, and become part of everyday life for the inhabitants of the planet.

This has had an interesting side-effect: Earth has become perceptible and observable for the remaining Star Engines.  And although they cannot communicate with poor dead Jayanoth anymore, his collision did leave an anchor point in the Fold through which the Star Engines can reach out us, and call out to us, and eventually even pluck us away.
