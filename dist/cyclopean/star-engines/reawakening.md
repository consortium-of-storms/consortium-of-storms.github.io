### Reawakening

In time, the surviving Star Engines began to rewaken, but to a horrible half-existence.  In their comatose state, the Distant Powers, empires which had so wholly relied on the Star Engines to thrive, had been without one half of their equation.  They had been abandoned to their fate, and to this day the Star Engines do not know if any survived or fled.

Where there were once entire sporelike clouds fleets of the living supersentient vessels, only six remained after the reawakening.  They were: Aqatarid, Jayanoth, Myacenid, Qia'amon, Shanaoth, and Veya'raj.  At least, those were the only ones capable of hearing or responding to the Whispers.

Without their inhabitant colonies to populate them, the Star Engines had no way to perceive the cosmos.  They had no way to navigate it, no way to propel at all.  They were forever adrift in total sensory deprivation, with only one another to speak to.  Who knows how long they floated through space, nothing but cold and dreaming hulks?

Then, one day, a few million years before humanity was born, one of the Star Engines met the gravitational force of a young golden star, was pulled into orbit, and eventually collided with one of its planets and perished.  This was Jayanoth, and the planet was Earth.
