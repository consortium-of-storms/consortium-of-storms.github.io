### Epachaneyon and Luphaion

Epachaneyon was one of the most massive of the Star Engines, and also one of the foremost explorer cultures.  Epachaneyon had been one of the Engines which had vanished in the Breach, and it had been one of the first Void Engines who had returned, blasphemed by the Unknowable.

Luphaion had been the first Star Engine to attempt communication with the Void Engines.  It had emerged from one of the closest battle formations, and hurtled itself into the depths of the approaching Void Engine cloud, emitting a maddened and incoherent distressful cry.

The remaining Star Engines each say the same thing.  The story goes that they heard confused Whispers from the Star Engines on the battlefront.  The Whispers were as followed:

"Luphaion?"

And, then, after a moment, "Epachaneyon?"

And then there was a devastating wave of feedback and disruption, shattering the consciousness of the Star Engines and casting them adrift in the cosmos for eons.
