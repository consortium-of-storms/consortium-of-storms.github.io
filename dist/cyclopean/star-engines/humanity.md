### Humanity

The Star Engines have been plucking humans into the Fold for longer than recorded history, but their experiments did not immediately result in Cyclopeans like the modern Infected.

The process of Engraving was, all in all, designed entirely in a way which was suitable to the Distant Powers - a race which had symbiotically evolved to be amenable to the Engraving.  The same process, innocent with that symbiotic race, is devastating for a human.

Most of the first waves of Cyclopeans were disasters or outright casualties - even the successful primeval Cyclopeans were monstrous and unspeakable, and some of those still roam the darker reaches of the Fold, immortal and anguished.

Subsequent waves of Cyclopeans were generational increments of subtle improvement, each slightly less traumatized, mad and grotesque.  And with each wave, the unsympathetic Star Engines grow slightly more capable and slightly more aware.

Human tissues and fungal tissues have an inherently non-symbiotic interaction.  For humans, the Engraving is not an honor - it is a traumatic, consuming Infection of elaborate sentient molds.  The human tissues struggle eternally to reject the fungus they play host to.

Pragmatically, although the process of Engraving has been thoroughly refined over the last ten thousand years, there are still dire consequences.

For one, almost all Cyclopeans eventually go mad or incoherent.  The fungal tissues aside, there is an incubating insanity which boils at the edge of the human psyche every time it experiences the Fold and every time it hears the Unearthly Whispers.

This madness isn't confined to the Cyclopeans, either.  Everywhere a Cyclopean goes, the fold is just a tiny bit easier to perceive.  This is a hellish, unsettling experience for any human: glimpses of impossible geometry, spatial incoherence, and monstrous Fold creatures or their obscene tissues.

History is littered with cautionary tales of seeking the Unknowable, and though the Fold and the Star Engines are the natural enemies of the _actual_ Unknowable, to humanity there is no practical distinction.
