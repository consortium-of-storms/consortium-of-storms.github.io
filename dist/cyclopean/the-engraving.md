## The Engraving

You were restrained with the fleshy embrace of cold, wet fungal lobes within the theater, and then you were constricted until you absolutely still.  You could feel the contours and textures of the living machine, and then shortly after you could feel its sharp devices press into your skin and begin to tear you apart.

Every last moment of this process is seared vividly into your memories, every second of your vivisection.  You remember the sensation of being hollowed out, every obscene organic sound.  You remember when the pulsating mass entered you again, filled you up, and begin to knit you back together.

You don't know why you didn't die.  Did you die?  Are you dead?  Maybe.

There came a point where the cradle you were in stilled for a second or two, and then it began to churn and swirl again.  You were swept up anew, flushed through some sort of channel, and eventually you were vomited out upon the floor of a large, dimly phosphorescent chamber.

Your discarded organs and an impossible amount of blood surrounded you, covering you like the rags which used to be your clothes.  You shook violently with the cold and the shock of the trauma and you stared.

And there, in that low luminescence, in that lonely new biomechanical cavity: that was when you first began to perceive the Unearthly Whispers.  You began to feel the new organs inside of you whirl and churn and _activate_.

It told you that you had survived the Engraving.  It welcomed you back, but from where you don't know.  It said that the time had come to once again face the Unknowable, the _things beyond the Fold of reality_.  It told you its name - it was unpronounceable, save for its honorific: 'of the Star Engines'.  It was a Star Engine.

Whispers of a distant memory infected your mind.  Not your memories, but anothers'.  Was it even your mind anymore?  What had you been infected with?  What had you become?
