## The Return

Now, months later, you have returned to Earth from the Star Engine's holding, but things aren't as they once were.  You aren't anything close to human anymore and madness tends to follow you wherever you go.  Your friends and family may have been the first, but they certainly won't be the last.

When you hear stories of alien abduction, your attention perks.  Usually the culprits of these stories are attention seekers, but sometimes _there's something to it_.  Something news of phenomena or curious happenstance are genuinely the touch of the extraterrestrial.  Sometimes it precipitates another who is like you - someone who has been Engraved.  A Cyclopean, one of the Infected.

You know that there are thousands more just like you, others who've been put under an organic imperative to serve the Star Engines.  Like you they are disfigured: though most of you can pass for human fully clothed, you certainly couldn't pass careful scrutiny.

For one, your chest is a lattice of grotesque scars, implementing a curious geometry into your flesh.  It's like a fractal demonstration of a dozen autopsies, and it's only the first of the tangible indications of your post-humanity.  There is so much more evidence of what you are than your scars, though.

There are the Apparata.  They are biomechanical machinery, distant micro-relatives of the massive Star Engine you were born in.  Inside you they unceasingly work - they keep you alive, let you cross into the Fold without dying, and they sometimes _turn you inside out, Inverting you into a completely new being_.

There are the Unearthly Whispers.  This is the living voice of the fungal symbiote you've been coupled with.  It is an actual living part of you now and it has a will which neighbors your own.  It speaks to you, it overlays the fabric of other realities on your vision, it warns you of danger and tells you secrets, and you're pretty sure that it _slowly drives the people around you mad_.

And there is the Lidless Eye.
