## Design notes

Liches take aboard ancient star spirits - pragmatically similar to demons but with a Lovecraftian flavor.  They become otherworldly and strong, and practice dramatic and flexible evil star magics.  Essentially the demon is like a shadow soul imprinted alongside the lich's human soul, corrupting his body and his intention.  Eventually the lich has to make a choice to either embrace the demon or reject it, each having its own benefits and drawbacks.

### What are Alignments?

Alignments are astrological periods where the Lich gains certain auspicious abilities.  An alignment is essentially a God-form, but in a transcendental vs. physical way.  Basically a player can say, at an arbitrary time, that they have a specific Alignment.  It's powerful but temporary, and discretionary.  In other words the stars don't actually need to be in alignment for the power to be invoked, it's just a story function.

Pragmatically, this means that an Alignment form is very powerful but also has a cooldown of sorts, basically an arbitrary timeframe picked in a particular way which will govern that individual power set the best.
