<h2 id="exquisite-designs">Exquisite Designs</h2>
<h3 id="you-were-made-to-serve-a-purpose">You were made to serve a purpose</h3>
<p>The Star Engines don&apos;t just cobble together sets of Apparata at random.  Everything serves a purpose for these ancient supersentients, and your capabilities are no different.</p>
<p>You were made with an Exquisite Design in mind: ultimately your function is to serve as a living embodiment of the Star Engine&apos;s internal ecosystem.  You were made to be a weapon, or a defense system, or to tend the Engine&apos;s terranean atmosphere, or to steer the Engine as it advances through the stars.</p>
<p>There are five major Designs and almost all Cyclopeans are Engraved with Apparata specifically to serve their Design.  Although the fungal origin of an offensive Apparatus could be distinct between two different instances of it in two different Infected, their purpose might be identical, and each instance would most commonly find itself within Cyclopeans Designed for the Swarm.</p>
<p>Each Swarm carries with it a set of responsibilities, and an overall function within their Star Engine of origin.  Eventually, the Star Engines would see themselves populated with enough Cyclopeans to take over all primary functionality: ideally, before the Unknowable have fully returned from the Fold, so that the remnant vessel Gods of the Distant Powers can have any hope of surviving the second coming of the ancient intergalactic conflict.</p>
<h3 id="stewards">Stewards</h3>
<p>Stewards intuitively command the atmosphere and temperature of the world around them.  They are the life support systems of the Star Engines, and without these Engraved none others can survive.  Stewards carve habitation out of desolation, and create to growth systems for future biomechanical needs.</p>
<p>At their strongest, Stewards were known to be able to terraform entire swaths of hospitable planetoids, creating outposts in the void sustained by a permaculture of spore colonies.   Food, air, drinkable fluids, healing beds: Stewards can spawn it any of it given enough time and practice.</p>
<p>In functional terms the Stewards are given to paths of nurturing and nourishment, and their Apparata reflect that.  They are the tenders of comfort and the genesis of life, they are responsible for the perpetuation of the Cyclopean existence.</p>
<p>This can turn dark in an instant, however, because although spreading the Cyclopean Infection is a noble act <em>for Cyclopeans</em> and posthumans in general, the sustaining arts of the Stewards are regularly hostile to other types of life.</p>
<p>If you were to travel back hundreds of years to see the Empires in their prime, you would see legions of subsumed planets: places where innocent and nascent bio matter had been consumed entirely by the ravenous Infection, all in the name of the war with the Unknowable.  You would see reaches of the Fold with an air thick with Cyclopean-nourshing spores, but thick also with micro organisms which immediately set upon and devoured anything else.</p>
<p>In other cases the life was allowed to continue but did so in an Infected way: nervous systems compromised, porous with encepalopathy, minds hollow in the service of new Cyclopean masters and their greater purpose.  Devoured from the inside out.</p>
<p>The weight of the posthuman Steward is one of balancing the terraforming, nourishing capabilities of their Apparata with the judicial mind of a former human who generally has no desire to expose their new nature, or harm fellow humans with the Infection.</p>

<p>The Armada Design is one implemented in such a way that it constructs and spreads ad-hoc species in from the purest fabrics of the Fold.  Armada Cyclopeans are the offensive and defensive modules of the Star Engines, designed to ultimately command entire fleets of mindless stellar beings.</p>

<h3 id="how-you-were-rebuilt">How you were rebuilt</h3>
<p>The old Empires of the Distant Powers had a rich technological history, but their machinery was quite different from our own.  The most important difference is that their engines were almost all fungal biomachinery.  Throughout the millennia that the Empires thrived, they cultivated a broad spectrum of production means which were either fungal itself, or spawn by some sort of fungus.</p>
<p>Today, these fungal agents are regularly bred and reused by the Star Engines in order to create Cyclopean Apparata.  A specific combination of originating Apparata creates a Cyclopean of a certain <em>Phenotype</em>, or in other words, a specific blend of Cyclopean features.</p>
<p>Each Phenotype is achieved through a combination of Apparata, but is ultimately a distinct semi-species within the Cyclopean hierarchy.  Phenotypes are most commonly distinguished by physical and psychological capabilities, but also they each have a governing Apparata synergy, which presents itself in a few beneficial and a few detrimental ways.</p>
<p>Within a certain Phenotype, Cyclopeans are still very distinct from one another - each Cyclopean has their own individual gradiation of progressions within their distinct Phenotype synergies.</p>
<p>Which is a fancy way of saying that, for example, while all of the Veya&apos;raj have access to the Veya&apos;rajian Hivemind, not all of them have developed it to the same extent, nor do they all suffer from the same distant qualities which overtake those who have.</p>
<p>In a pragmatic way, Phenotypes have formed subcultures within the Cyclopean superculture.  Although they aren&apos;t necessarily predisposed to liking one another, they absolutely have a lot in common with one another and this fosters a great deal of comfort.  It&apos;s traumatic to become a Cyclopean, to say the least, and finding others like yourself means a lot to a newly posthuman.</p>
